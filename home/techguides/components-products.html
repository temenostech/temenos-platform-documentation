<h1 id="components--feature-description">Components – Feature Description</h1>
<p>Components are individually deployable units that are understood by Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform based on the component type that each component refers to. </p>
<p>Each component is associated to a component type to help Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform deploy the component. </p>
<p>The <strong>Component Type</strong> field in the component data is the key to help the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform Controllers deploy the right components in the right way. 
An organization can define as many components as needed but should have all mandatory components defined in the templates that are assigned to the organization.</p>
<p>Practically when a template is assigned to an organization, a list of component types related to that template is added for that organization.</p>
<p>Each component has the following fields <em>(all mandatory)</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Component Type</p>
</li>
<li><p>Name</p>
</li>
<li><p>Description</p>
</li>
<li><p>Display Name</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</br></p>
<h2 id="component-type">Component Type</h2>
<p>The platform uses a convention/ protocol to deploy all parts required to run a full-fledged instance of T24 (Or any other product supported by a template). Such parts to constitute a complete system are called <strong>components</strong>. </p>
<p>The T24 installation may have the following components (No exhaustive or inclusive):</p>
<ul>
<li>T24-Jars</li>
<li>T24-ud</li>
<li>Helptext</li>
<li>Tafj-installer etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each item in this list is called a <strong>component type</strong>. </p>
<p>The names of these parts / Component Types are fixed and are not user editable. This is managed internally by the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform admin/ development group and can only be changed or modified by this group. </p>
<p>Each component type represents a deployable unit and has an ansible script associated to it. </p>
<p>These components have a structure associated and work in a standardized manner across different deployment stacks (OS, App server variations, DB variations etc).</p>
<p> The components are sorted from A to Z and you are able to search/ filter the component by name. The list displays all the components available for your Organization.</p>
<blockquote><p><p style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:red"><strong>WARNING:</strong></span><span style="color:red">
<span style="color:red"></span><span style="color:red">make sure to follow the naming convention as defined by the Temenos team. Any adjustments to the components&#39; title such as adding special characters or spaces will result in a failed factory run.<p>
<p>Example: downloading the same file multiple times auto-numbers the file name from 1 onwards - t24-jars-63688104355895 <strong>(1)</strong>.zip and adds a space as well. Please use the .zip file that has the original title - <strong>t24-jars-63688104355895.zip</strong>. </p>

<h1 id="how-to-set-up-delete-components">How to Set Up/ Delete Components</h1>
<h2 id="set-up-create-a-component">Set-up/ Create a Component</h2>
<ul>
<li>Login to the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Click on <strong>Settings</strong> button on the left menu &gt; this will expand a menu containing buttons for: Streams, Stages, Products, Factory and General</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>Stream</strong> <em>(top-right)</em> where you want to add the respective component</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click on <strong>New Components</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the Component Type from the dropdown list and fill in the <strong>Component Name</strong>, <strong>Component Description</strong>, and <strong>Component Display Name</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Create</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>See below example:</p>
<p><img src="images/products-add-component.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A folder is automatically created into the repository <em>(we are using JFrog Artifactory)</em> with the name of your component and will be always created under the default <strong>CONFIGURATION_STAGE</strong> stage. This is the path where the components&#39; files should be uploaded as explained on the next steps.</p>
<p><em>(Please note that the components&#39; artifacts can be uploaded any time before running a factory).</em></p>
<p><em>(If the related artifacts are not uploaded, running the factory will not be possible and an error message will be thrown).</em></p>
<p> To see the details of a component please make sure to first select the stream from the top-right-side menu. The list with the components that belong to the respective stream will be displayed on the left side of the page. The same operation applies for the products.</p>
<p><br>
</br></p>
<h1 id="how-to-login-to-artifactory">How to login to Artifactory</h1>
<p>Every user created in the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform can log in with the platform’s credential on the Artifactory server as well. Follow the steps below to login to the Artifactory:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>go on the left-side menu on the portal and click on <strong>Metadata</strong>. 
<img src="images/sanity-general.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>here are the metadata settings:
<img src="images/components-and-products-artifactoryurl.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>copy the <strong>Artifactory URL</strong> and open it in another browser. To login use with your credentials from the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform. This is how your Artifactory will be displayed:
<img src="images/artifactory-login.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>to see the artifactory repository, click on the Artifactory icon from the left-side menu. The repository belonging to your organisation will be displayed (to make sure you expand the right repository, always check the naming convention: repo-1dq4zcowcn75s1, where what follows after &#39;repo-&#39; represents the ID of your organisation:
<img src="images/local-repository.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</br></p>
<h2 id="how-to-upload-binaries-into-the-artifactory">How to upload binaries into the Artifactory</h2>
<p>The users are enabled to download the existing artifacts or upload new artifacts that will be used for factories. This process can be done in two ways:</p>
<p><strong>A. Manually access the artifactory and upload the required binary (recommended).</strong></p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>new user</strong>: it is mandatory for the user to have assigned a role which contains CREATE  <em>  COMPONENT and MANAGE </em> COMPONENTS permissions.</li>
<li><strong>existing user</strong>: if a user wants to log in to the Artifactory server, the user must change its password and have the CREATE <em> COMPONENT and MANAGE  </em> COMPONENTS permissions within the role that was assigned to it. To learn how to change the user roles and permissions please refer to this <a href="http://documentation.temenos.cloud/home/user-creation-in-paas.html#user-roles-management">link</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE"><h5>Note</h5><ul>
<li>for an already created user that wants to have access to the Artifactory Server, the user must change its password and if its role has those 2 permissions, the user will be added in Artifactory Server</li>
<li>if the user’s role is updated afterwards , the user still needs to change its password in order to be added to the Artifactory Server</li>
<li>the user cannot delete artifacts from the Artifactory Server.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><img src="images/products-deploy-artifactory.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Select single or multi depending on the number of archives you need to add, drag and drop or select the archive and then click <strong>deploy</strong>.  </p>
<p><img src="images/products-deploy-files.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You will see a success message and the archive under your component.</p>
<div class="NOTE"><h5>Note</h5><p>Components artifacts are delivered to clients by Temenos Distribution team.
Also the binaries/ artifacts have to be uploaded each time a component is updated.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>B. Invoke an Artifactory API that will upload the required binary into the appropriate location.</strong></p>
<p>In order to invoke that Artifactory API a CURL command must be executed (this can be run manually from a linux VM or from a bash script).</p>
<pre><code>curl -H &quot;X-JFrog-Art-Api:&lt;ArtifactoryKey&gt;&quot; -X PUT &quot;&lt;DestinationURL&gt;&quot; -T &lt;fileToUpload&gt;
</code></pre><ul>
<li><p>The <strong>ArtifactoryKey</strong> can be taken from the TCD portal (go to General and take the value of ARTIFACTORY_KEY record):</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>DestinationURL</strong> represents the exact location of the file that will be uploaded in the artifactory together with the name of the binary. For this operation, you need to take the exact path of the artifactory from the TCD portal from the Upload URL field that is displayed on the screen after the component is created:
<img src="images/components-and-products-uploadurl.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>fileToUpload</strong> represents the binary that should be uploaded from your local machine and it must contain also the path where is present.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE"><h5>Note</h5><p>Open source doesn’t support multiple file uploads at a time, therefore you need to upload the required binaries one by one.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Example of the curl command based on the above</strong>: 
curl -H &quot;X-JFrog-Art-Api:AKPp5dKYsrreear46t4e6ett7t7x6pZZnRMteeffsLE9Q3qds6V&quot; &quot;<a href="https://1dtk4nz95bmnw-artifactory.temenos.cloud/artifactory/repo-1dtk4nz95tssg/dev_stream/demo_stage/t24-jars">https://1dtk4nz95bmnw-artifactory.temenos.cloud/artifactory/repo-1dtk4nz95tssg/dev_stream/demo_stage/t24-jars</a>&quot; -T /drives/c/Users/file/t24-jars-63688104355895.zip</p>
<p>For demo purposes, we used MobaXterm to upload the binary into the Artifactory as displayed below:
<img src="images/components-products-mobaxterm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once the command is run, the binary is uploaded on the Artifactory:
<img src="images/components-products-uploaded-binary.png" alt=""></p>
<p><br>
</br></p>
<h1 id="pre-requisites-and-best-practices">Pre-requisites and best practices</h1>
<p>•   ensure that the component name also has information about its version</p>
<p>•   ensure that the component format that you upload is as expected by Temenos Continuous Deployment - every product has a template overview page (see <a href="http://documentation.temenos.cloud/home/pdf/transact-components.pdf">here</a> the expected components&#39; format)</p>
<p>•   ensure that the components are uploaded to the appropriate folders (the URL and folder names can be found from the component definition pages of the Temenos Continuous Deployment portal)</p>
<p>•   if the component is uploaded in a .zip format, it is recommended to have a text file describing what is included in the package/ provide reference to the code commit tags to find what is included in the package</p>
<p>•   do not delete/ edit/ create components/ folders in the artifactory. The Temenos Continuous Deployment Portal’s Product and Component sections must be used to create anything in artifactory</p>
<p>•   our recommendation is to retain the last 25 components in every stage.</p>
<p><br>
</br></p>
<h1 id="which-components-to-add">Which Components to Add</h1>
<p>In order to know which are the minimum required components that you need to add, you must first check the <strong>Templates Catalog</strong> (see button on the left menu).</p>
<p>From here, select the template that you want to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>make sure you select first the Template Type (FCM, T24, Tools, Wealth etc.). </li>
<li>from the available Templates Catalog, select the one that you need in order to check the components.</li>
<li>under Full Template Content, scroll until you see the <strong>components</strong> section.</li>
<li><span style="color:red"><strong>Note:</strong></span><span style="color:red"> usually there are at least two <strong>components</strong> sections: one related to T24 and another one refers to Model Bank Database (or other db). Depending on the template type, there could be more components, so please make sure you scroll down to check entirely the template in order to add all required components.</span></li>
<li>it is required to add at least all the mandatory components.</li>
<li><p><span style="color:red">In addition to the mandatory components, you will need to add those components you need to test in the <strong>TestScript</strong> component - this not related to your selected template and the user needs to create it manually.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><p style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:red"><strong>WARNING:</strong> the TestScript component needs to be a .zip file within a .zip, otherwise the factory run will fail. See example below:</span><span style="color:red">
<span style="color:red"></span><span style="color:red"><p>
<p><img src="images/components-test-script.png" alt=""></p>
</span></span></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>For all added components, make sure you add the related files archive into the artifactory as explained above.</p>
</li>

<h1 id="products--feature-description">Products – Feature Description</h1>
<p>A product is a logical grouping of several components. This is just to make it easy for users to select a list of components to deploy instead of selecting each component in a sequence. </p>
<p>A product has the following fields <em>(all mandatory)</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Name</p>
</li>
<li><p>Description</p>
</li>
<li><p>List of constituent components - at least one component is required </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, a product is used in a factory and will be used eventually to deploy the required components.</p>
