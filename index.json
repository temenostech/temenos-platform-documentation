    "keywords": "Enterprise View This section provides an overview of what the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform solution is, and how it fits in with the wider Temenos and bank enterprise. Note: UTP is the Unified Temenos Platform, an exclusively internal Temenos program and an umbrella term for work related to improving the way we develop, build, test and release software. The TCD solution is composed of the Extend and Assemble modules to enable the provision of development and Integration test environments. The current state allows for these two modules only. Roadmap features envisage a Deliver module to cover pre-production and production environments. The TCD Extend module is a multi-tenanted provisioning and deployment module that provides Users and/ or other systems with self-service management of Environments and provides access to the tools for enhancing Client Licensed Temenos Software. The Extend module enables authorised Users to provision Environments from a list of Templates for non-production use during development, test, integration, implementation and ongoing changes to the Products. The Extend module is a cloud-hosted platform service and manages Environments in either the Temenos cloud or a Client’s Target Cloud account. Each Environment is a standalone instance of one or more Products or approved third-party applications / products running on the middleware defined in the Template. Each Factory is formed of an Environment and one or more Test Clients. The Test Clients have their own Templates, which define their infrastructure, software Components and configuration. The TCD Assemble module performs the test pipeline automation, continuous integration (“CI”) and continuous delivery (“CD”) of Client’s changes to Client’s Licensed Temenos Software. The Assemble Module utilises the same technologies as the Extend module, and does: deploy Test Clients; execute the Clients’ tests; orchestrate the deployment of Environments with Factories and the promotion of Packages through a workflow; manage storage of test results and application logs; manage the lifecycle of test Environments; provide a dashboard of test results with links to the underlying manifests, templates and, where appropriate, running Environments. The TCD test result dashboard is a multi-tenanted web application hosted and operated by Temenos. The dashboard shows historic test results for a Factory within a configured Release and trends through a web UI pulling data from the Assemble Modules local database and test results and application logs in Target Cloud storage. The TCD Artefact Repository is a third-party artefact repository “Artifactory by Jfrog” . The repository holds all the built software Components that are referenced by the Templates at the relevant test and deploy Stages. The Client will push all of its Product packages to the Artefact Repository"

The clients will be supplied with a URL and initial login, from there they will be able to create their own environments at their chosen release, add users for a developer or team of developers and then they can create the environments immediately. The users can create up to the maximum number of environments purchased, once the environment is destroyed, another individual or team can create a new environment up to the maximum. Thus many users can share a single subscription, removing collaboration barriers across the project team while supporting automated testing. Who will handle customers’ queries/issues for Deployment Platform? Sales queries will be handled via the Temenos SaaS (CloudPlatformSupport@temenos.com) support team.

    "keywords": "What is Temenos Continuous Deployment? Temenos Continuous Deployment is a cloud based infrastructure used during development, test, implementation, and ongoing change with configurable and scalable Temenos Suites on-demand, unless otherwise stated. Temenos Continuous Deployment enables you to create Environments, i.e. Temenos Suites on-demand, for non-production use in the cloud. Environments can be requested and provisioned within minutes rather than weeks helping you accelerate your projects. Retail Suite is readily available, with all other Temenos Suites (Corporate, Wealth, Micro-Finance and Islamic Banking) available on request and allows you to develop and test your proof of concept, share development environments across dispersed teams, replicate production environments or use them for training. The speed, reliability, and agility of these environments will instantly add value to your implementation and scale your project delivery capacity. Temenos Continuous Deployment is an offering that provides client individuals and teams with the ability to manage, configure and assemble client licensed Temenos Software – either fully deployed and supported by Temenos SaaS or utilising the client’s own cloud infrastructure. Temenos Continuous Deployment What is the “Assemble” service module of the Temenos Continuous Deployment? “Assemble” service module provides a DevOps solution to perform continuous integration and delivery of Temenos Products and customisation, thereby enabling faster time to market for features. The Assemble service module of Temenos Continuous Deployment is used during the continuous integration (“CI”) and continuous delivery (“CD”) of Temenos solutions. The Assemble service module can accelerate the pace of change and increase confidence in the software deliveries by managing the Assemble of Components (updates, main release, and Level 3 developments), the provisioning into testing Environments, the execution of tests scripts, and providing detailed dashboards of the results. This Assemble service module further allows the Client to configure Products and Releases which match their own specific needs. The main objective being to streamline ongoing change and accelerate implementation / upgrade projects. Features Self-service environment provisioning An authenticated user, e.g. a developer or tester, has the ability to request an environment from the catalogue of templates ; this template will be materialised into compute, storage, and networks on the Temenos SaaS See architecture . The administrator, e.g. the project manager, is in control of number of the users and maximum number of running environments, thus having total control of the platform and its usage. Secure configuration and environment management A developer, is able to configure a personal SSH Key on their user profile and use this key to securely push changes over SSH. Deployment of change into the environment is fully automated for configuration, updates, plugins, add-ons and data. These changes can be stored in a software configuration management repository and deployed to the environment via a Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment process. Controlling the environment A user is able to scale up, scale down, start, stop, delete, and export data from an environment. Furthermore, a user is able to push a database into the configuration repository and rebuild the environment, thereby refreshing the database back to that point in time and re-apply transactions and configuration as required. As an example, a developer or a tester can load a database and collaborate to validate changes and test cases in a shared environment. Should these users need to delete or migrate an environment, they can export the data, create a fresh environment with the latest release, upload the data and continue working all managed through the portal. When development activity requires additional resources, the users can easily scale up the environments and equally reduce capacity or stop it entirely. Monitoring the environment A user can export the application log data, monitor the status of the environments (started, starting, stopped, stopping, rebuilding), and see the results of any application deployments. Controlling the application The Temenos core banking template exposes endpoints for the user interface and TAFJEE management screens that allows a user to control COB job services. Managed Resources Users Each user has their own profile within an Organisation. Please check here more details about Users. Environments An environment is an instance of an application and the platform provides the facilities to manage the application configuration. Organisations The users of the platform can provision and manage the environments within their Organisation. Please check here for more details about Temenos SaaS management of Organisations and Environments. Templates Environments can be provisioned using a variety of pre-defined application, processing, storage, network, and operating system configurations. Please check here for more details. Data and Security Considerations The Temenos Continuous Deployment is for non-production use only , unless otherwise stated. No 'personal data'; 'confidential' or 'sensitive' data should be stored on any Environment. • Data is stored in UK datacentres • Data is encrypted in transit • Access to management facilities requires username/password and/or SSH certificates • Environments can be deleted immediately by the user. All client-related data will be deleted by Temenos 60 days after the termination of the agreement"

There are a number of options: 1. All hosted on Temenos SaaS - this is Azure; 2. The Platform component is hosted on Temenos SaaS. The Target Cloud is a bank’s public cloud - the hybrid model (target cloud is an Azure subscription owned by the bank); 3. All hosted on the bank’s cloud - all hosted on the bank’s AWS account. The advantages of the various offerings: a) Temenos hosted - this is a full-service SaaS offering with Support desk, monitoring, SLAs. The bank benefits from the regular rollout of new features. There are no technical pre-requisites to use the service. A service/hosting agreement is required with Temenos SaaS. b) The Hybrid model - Temenos hosts the platform, but the T24 (or other Temenos applications) are spun up in a bank-owned cloud environment. The bank still gets support desk and benefits from the regular rollout of new platform features. This option is more complex and has a number of technical pre-requisites to use the service. To provision on the bank’s Azure cloud, the bank needs to provide: I. a Subscription; II. a Service Principal; III. a Resource Group to which the Service Principal had full privileges; IV. B2B collaboration with the bank’s AAD for the subscription. We require the subscription to be dedicated to sole use for TCD environments. A service agreement is required with Temenos SaaS for the use of the platform component. The bank will be billed directly by their cloud provider for the infrastructure used in their cloud. Provisioning to the bank’s AWS account is a bespoke configuration and the Temenos team needs to work through the setup and pre-requisites with the bank. c) The bank runs it all on their public cloud (AWS or Azure) - there is no service element to this; the bank has full responsibility for installing and operating the platform. There are two primary service models depending on whether the client is using Temenos SaaS for both the service, and the Target Cloud; or using their own cloud environment for the Target Cloud."

The TestCases folder appears in the repository under the created stage just after the added components as in the example below: It will not be possible to run a factory without uploading the test-cases into the respective folder. Click on the TestCases folder, then in Deploy button on the top right. From here choose Single or Multi based on number of zip folders that you need to upload and drop or select the test cases zip file.

    "keywords": "Stage API/UI – Feature Description A Stage is a logical name for a promotional stage. Every component/module developed by an organization needs to go through several steps to be declared ready for deployment to product. These steps are exactly what we call stages. Each stage has the following fields: 1. Name: A simple name for the stage Note The name can only be set on creation time and it cannot be updated . 2. Description: A simple description to be helpful to users. 3. Enabled/ Disabled Flag: A stage can be enabled or disabled at any time provided there are no Factories associated to it. When a new stage is created, an isolated folder is created in the Artifactory Server to enable the binary/ installable components to be uploaded. When the components work well with other components/modules, the component is promoted to other stages, as defined by factories. The promotion of the components across stages is conditional based on the status of tests that are done during a factory run. If the tests succeed, the components will be promoted to the next stage. How to Set Up/ Edit/ Delete Stages Set-up/ Create a Stage Login to the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform. Click on Settings button on the left menu > this will expand a menu containing buttons for: Streams, Stages, Products, Factory and General. Click on Stage button, make sure you select the Stream where you want to add a stage and then on the New Stage on the top right. Fill the name (mandatory field) . Take into account these conditions (also notified on the screen): Name can start only with a letter or an underscore and it can contain only letters, digits, underscores or hyphens. Fill the description (mandatory field) . Check the Enable option and then click Create . Note : Instead of choosing the enable option, you can create a disabled stage and enable it later, but the default option should be enable. Edit a Stage Compared to the streams, a stage can have only the description edited/ changed, but not the name. Why? Because when creating a stage, a folder is created automatically in the Artifactory containing the stage name. This folder will contain the components that you may be added for the respective stage. Just click the edit button, change the description and then click update. Default Stage After logging to the portal, go to the General button on the left menu. Here you can see and edit the metadata. The DEFAULT_STAGE_NAME can be defined after the creation of an organization in order to be able to use the assemble functionalities and can be editable . In case it has not been defined at the beginning, then when you try to create a stream, a new field about default stage will appear and here you need to insert a name for the default stage. This field will be automatically added into the metadata and will not be editable . Delete a Stage Note The default stage cannot be deleted. (This is the stage configured into the metadata). Example: Suppose we have created a stage named Primary_stage. No matter if we have configured further components and products, we can just go and delete this stage. Any other created stage can be deleted at any moment as it is not dependent of the subsequent features added such as components and products. Components and Products belong to the streams. Example of the default stage defined into the metadata (you can set any name you prefer instead of default_stage ):"

    "keywords": "Stream UI – Feature Description A Stream is a collective name representing all coordinated efforts by an organization (that are registered to use the Assemble module) to make a specific improvement to their deployed product. For example a bank that is running T24 can choose to make a new enhancement to the T24 installation. All efforts to develop, test and release this enhancement can be collectively called a stream . It represents a group dedicated to a specific development feature (or other logical grouping to represent a new feature implementation etc.) that may consist of the following resources: People – Developers, testers, business managers and other people involved in developing new features for the bank. Code and other digital resources – Code specific to the features, Binaries, VMs, Test Scripts etc. Processes – Each team works with a different workflow and may have variations in the processes. Each stream requires an isolated setup of resources to keep their work separate from other streams. For example, each stream will have a separate folder (or repository) for all of their digital resources and can possibly implement a customized workflow for their development promotion. Each stream has other inherent components for it to be useful. The parts of the stream are listed below: Stages Components Products Factories Factory Run Environments These components, together, act as an isolated group of elements for each Stream and help an organization create and manage efforts of a group. An organization can create as many streams as needed. Each stream is just a logical name for the grouping and has nothing more than a “Name” and a “Description”. How to Set-up/ Edit/ Delete Streams Set-up/ Create a Stream Login to the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform Click on Settings button on the left menu > this will expand a menu containing buttons for: Streams, Stages, Products, Factory and General.

Fill the description (mandatory field) . Check the Enable option and then click Create . Note : Instead of choosing the enable option, you can create a disabled stream and enable it later, but the default option should be enable. After the successful creation, your stream will appear on the screen (in case you already have other streams, the newly created will be the last in chronological order) and it will automatically have associated the default stage named 'Stable_Dev' (as in current example). Please note that the default stage name is defined in the metadata settings of your organization (On the main menu > General). Edit a Stream You can edit anytime the name, the description of the stage or choose the disable option by clicking the edit button. Delete a Stream Note In order to delete a stream, you need to delete first all the subsequent features created. See example and explanations below. Example 1: Suppose we have created a stream named Dev2 that has just the default stage and without adding other stages or configuring further components and products. We can just go and delete this stream (even if it has the stable_dev associated to it). Example 2: Suppose we have created a stream named Dev that has the default stage (stable_dev) and also a stage named Primary_stage, without configuring further components and products. In order to be able to delete a stream that has more than the stable_dev stage , we need first to go and delete the stages attached to it. Go first to Stages button on the left menu > Select first your stream (top right) > Select the stage that you want to delete (others then stable_dev - because this stage cannot be deleted ) > And click the delete button. Go back to Streams and you will notice that your stream has only the stable_dev stage associated, therefore you are able to delete the stream. Click the Delete button. If you have added other stages and also components and products, first delete all the products, then the components, then the associated stages and finally you will be able to delete the stream. In case you skip one of these features deletion, the system will notify that is not possible to delete the respective stage."

    "keywords": "Introduction This user guide shows different ways of accessing details related to your development environment when deploying the following: Design Studio Packages Plugins Updates WAR files 1. Export Environment Details The Export Environment Details functionality gives you access to different information related to your sandbox like: -> the T24 UD (default) folder from your T24 sandbox -> the jars deployed in your T24 sandbox -> the war files deployed(with success or not) in your T24 sandbox -> the jboss server.log from your T24 sandbox. The environment details are exported in a SFTP server to which you have to connect in order to download the related files in your local machine. For this purpose, make sure you download and install WinSCP SFTP client. The Export Environment Details functionality can be triggered from PaaS Portal following the bellow steps: Log-in to your organisation in PaaS Portal, go to your enviroment page and click on the Export Environment button for the T24 application. After click, the Export Environment button will become disabled(as per bellow picture), meaning that the export was triggered. Note The Export Environment action is finished when the Export Environment button becomes enabled. In order to download the exported files of your environment from the SFTP server to your local machine: In PaaS Portal for your organisation, go to your environment page and Right click and copy the sftp.temenos.cloud Endpoint or click the copy to clipboard icon from the right: Open WinSCP SFTP client and create a new site that will allow you to connect to the SFTP server. Make sure you put tcdSFTP.temenos.cloud Endpoint as Host name, your PaaS user as User name and instead of password, the SSH key related to your PaaS user must be used. In order to attach the SSH key, press Advanced button, go to Authentification menu and select the private key related to your PaaS user. After attaching your SSH key, save your site with any name for future use. Click Login to connect to the SFTP server. If connection is successful, you will have 2 sections in WinSCP: -> the left section(highlighted in black) represents the location from your local machine where the environment details will be downloaded. -> the right section(highlighted in yellow) represents the location of the exported environment details in the SFTP server; the environment details are saved in the SFTP server in /organisationID/environmentID folder structure. Go inside your environmentID folder and you will see a zip file that contains the Environment Details. In order to download the zip, select it and press F5. After downloading the zip file to your local machine, unzip it. Based on the template used, you will be able to see the below scenarios: a) For Extend-Templates - once you downloaded the file and unzipped it on your local machine, the below folders will appear b) For Wildfly, Stack01 and Stack02 Templates - once you downloaded the file and unzipped it on your local machine, the below folders will appear: Based on the above folder structure, you can check the following: -> If you deployed any update in your sandbox, check if jar/jars related to the update are changed in the jar list from modules/com/temenos/t24/main folder. -> If you deployed any package in your sandbox, check if the jar related to the package is present in modules/com/temenos/t24/main/localjars folder. -> If you deployed any war file in your sandbox, check if the war was deployed with success(a file named war_name.deployed should be present in standalone\\deployments folder). The war deployment will be failed if a file named war_name.failed is present in standalone\\deployments folder and this file must be checked for details. > [!Note] > For Stack02 Template in the 'appserver' folder you will find 'installed apps' folder instead of 'deployments'. 2. TAFJEE Monitoring Tool TAFJEE Monitoring Tool can be used in the following situations: -> To get the TAFJ installation details from your Environment (using tDiag Servlet) -> To get the compilation details for a T24 routine from your Environment (using tShow Servlet) -> To access various logs from your Environment like Database log or Runtime log (using Logger Servlet) -> To access como content from your Environment (using Como Servlet) -> To execute DBTools commands (using DBTools Servlet). To access the TAFJE Monitoring Tool for your Environment, log-in to your organisation in PaaS Portal, go to your enviroment page and click on the MONITOR APPLICATION Endpoint for the T24 application. The bellow page is opened from which various servlets can be accessed. TAFJ Environment Information To view various information about the TAFJ Environment from your Environment, access the TAFJ Monitoring Tool of your Environment from PaaS Portal and select tDiag option from the Diagnostic section. The next page is opened in which information like TAFJ installation details, Environment details, TAFJ Runtime properties, T24 Monitoring properties and TAFJ Session Monitor properties can be found. T24 Routine Information To view the compilation details for a T24 Routine from your Environment, access the TAFJ Monitoring Tool of your Environment from PaaS Portal and select tShow option from the Diagnostic section. The next page is opened in which you must enter the name of the T24 Routine. Click Submit to get the compilation details. The details like compilation date or the .jar file that contains the class of the T24 Routine are displayed.

Expert managed services provide full mission-critical service delivery leaving you to focus on your customers. Services Extend The Extend module of the Temenos Continuous Deployment Paltform is used by the ‘change the bank’ teams for self-service management of Environments and provides access to the tools for enhancing Temenos solutions. The Extend module is an online software portal, which enables authorised Extends to provision Environments from a list of Templates. These Environments are for non-production use during development, test, integration, implementation, phases and ongoing changes to the Products. Self service provisioning of Environments, within minutes rather than weeks, can help accelerate development and ongoing change. Temenos is able to create production like Templates for any of the Temenos Product Suites (Retail, Corporate, Wealth, Micro-Finance, and Islamic Banking). This production like Environments enable the Client to develop and test more realistically at proof of concept, demonstrate more representative enhancements across their teams, and perform more life-like scenarios within training. The speed, reliability, and agility of these Environments will instantly add value to Client’s implementation of Temenos Products and scale your project delivery capacity. Service Definition - Find out more here . Assemble The Assemble module of TCD is used during the continuous integration (“CI”) and continuous delivery (“CD”) of Temenos solutions. The Assemble module can accelerate the pace of change and increase confidence in the software deliveries by managing the Assemble of Components (updates, main release, Level 3 developments), the provisioning into testing Environments, the execution of tests scripts, and providing detailed dashboards of the results. This Assemble module further allows the Client to configure Products and Releases which match their own specific needs. The main objective being to streamline ongoing change and accelerate implementation / upgrade projects. Service definition - Find out more here . Technical Overview This section shows the current state deployment architecture of the TCD platform. The deployment allows for some organisations to be hosted within the Temenos SaaS and others to be hosted on the Customer's Azure subscription. Figure : Deployment View Each component within the current state architecture is exposed over public internet with a public IP address (PIP). Firewalls are embedded into the Virtual Machines. Each Azure resource as per the diagram above has its own basic Network Security Group NSG rules implemented. There are 2 installations of the Configuration Management software (Ansible), each piggy-backed onto another VM. Jenkins is used for both internal CI purposes and for building sandboxes. Command Line Access Command line access to the Sandbox Virtual Machines is restricted to Temenos employees only. Access is granted to users who have a SSH key which is shared amongst Temenos employees who need Command Line access. Development and Release Process The practice of Continuous Integration is currently followed, with developers of the TCD platform checking features into 'feature branches' frequently, and automated builds/tests being executed by the CI server (Jenkins) to verify fundamental sanity checks of the changes. The TCD source code branching method includes the concept of a 'master' branch, which means all development is performed on feature branches, and changes are only ever merged onto the master. This means that the master branch is always production ready. The precise 'release to production' process is currently being aligned across the core components (Infra Module, Controller, Portal), and varies on a per-component basis, however the majority of change migration is performed using a standardised CI pipeline (on Jenkins) in the form of a push-button migration. Changes are only migrated to production following certain quality check procedures; including code review, functional test and documentation where applicable. Patching and Upgrades Process Patching and upgrades of software/libraries used by the TCD platform is currently performed on an ad-hoc basis depending on criticality and feature requirements. Get started with TCD and check our user guides, tutorials and more information about the platform."

    "title": "Architecture Overview",
    "keywords": "Architecture Overview Where does Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform fit into the enterprise IT landscape? The Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform (TCD) promotes the concept of simplified and standardised change promotion through the IT landscape. Typical organisations have a number of non-production (i.e. development/test) environments, where changes are implemented and checked prior to deployment to production systems. The Devops movement seeks to improve this QA process through means of automation, which both allows an increase in speed in change promotion, and a reduction in the risk of manual errors when promoting changes. The Development Platform includes a simple and repeatable method of collating changes (both configuration and customisation) which subsequently is simple to promote from environment to environment. In addition, the core function of the Deployment Platform is to simplify the environment provisioning process, which means if extra stages in the change flow are required (e.g. for additional testing phases), it becomes far simpler to spin up temporary environments for these purposes. It should be noted that the Development platfrom only supplies non-production environments (also known as 'sandboxes'), which means organisations will still require at least one non-production environment on representative hardware in order to sanity check changes prior to production release (see example below). Delegating platform and infrastructure responsibilities to a third party allows organisations to concentrate on what is important to them - applications and data. The Deployment platform may be used for simple environment provisioning, or may be augmented by additional tools (such as Continuous Integration tooling) to provide a streamlined and automated development experience. The change promotion mechansim within the TCD is simple to plug into standard CI tooling to push code/config/data from environment to environment. An example development flow is shown below: What are the components of Temenos Continuous Deployment? Development & Testing environments are managed by the Development Portal, and are comprised of distinct components as described below: Component Description Portal The Portal is the front-end component of the Deployment Platform which allows users to perform management functions across development environments. These functions include user management and environment provisioning/scaling. Configuration Repository The Configuration Repository is the 'change hub' for the Deployment Platform. It supports configuration and customisation (per environment), including T24 updates, custom config/code packages, database imports and third party plug-ins/add-ons. T24 Instance The T24 instance comprises the application and database for T24. The application tier may be scaled horizontally as required (via the management facility in the Portal). Exports (File Storage) The T24 database may be exported via the management facility in the Portal, as may the 'environment' (file system level). These exports are stored per environment and may be downloaded by users via SFTP. What can you do with Temenos Continuous Deployment? Below is a list of functions which can be performed using Temenos Continuous Deployment. Function Description Provision a new environment Create an environment Scale an environment Scale a environment horizontally by adding/removing additional T24 instances for a given database instance Delete a environment Delete a environment Manage a user Create/ edit/ delete a user Apply configuration/ customisation Apply the necessary change components to create a customised environment configuration for an organisation Login to T24 Use the resultant customised environment Import a database Import a database into a environment Export a database Export a database from a environment (e.g. to re-import into another environment) Export an environment Export a copy of a environment (file system level) for offline perusal What tools do I need to use Temenos Continuous Deployment? Below is a list of tools which may be used to exploit Temenos Continuous Deployment functionality. Tool Description and Rationale Git Git (/ɡɪt/) is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. A client program for Git is required to push artefacts into the configuration repository. SFTP Client SFTP is the protocol used to download file exports (environment or database exports) Continuous Integration Tool (Optional) Continuous Integration tools may be used to help automate change promotion between environments. There is no CI tool provided as part of the Temenos Continuous Deployment, but these are useful in reducing manual tasks when managing environments. Design Studio (Optional) Design Studio is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) produced by Temenos for developing changes in T24 systems. Design Studio itself does not form part of the Deployment Platform, but change outputs from this tool are supported within the Configuration Repository. Enterprise View This section provides an overview of what the TCD solution is, and how it fits in with the wider Temenos and bank enterprise. Enterprise View The TCD solution is composed of the Extend and Assemble modules to enable the provision of development and Integration test environments. The current state allows for these two modules only. Roadmap features envisage a Deliver module to cover pre-production and production environments. The TCD Extend module is a multi-tenanted provisioning and deployment module that provides Users and/or other systems with self-service management of Environments and provides access to the tools for enhancing Client Licensed Temenos Software. The Extend module enables authorised Users to provision Environments from a list of Templates for non-production use during development, test, integration, implementation and ongoing changes to the Products. The Extend module is a cloud-hosted platform service and manages Environments in either the Temenos cloud or a Client’s Target Cloud account. Each Environment is a standalone instance of one or more Products or approved third-party applications / products running on the middleware defined in the Template. Each Factory is formed of an Environment and one or more Test Clients. The Test Clients have their own Templates, which define their infrastructure, software Components and configuration. The TCD Assemble module performs the test pipeline automation, continuous integration (“CI”) and continuous delivery (“CD”) of Client’s changes to Client’s Licensed Temenos Software. The Assemble Module utilises the same technologies as the Extend module, and does: deploy Test Clients; execute the Clients’ tests; orchestrate the deployment of Environments with Factories and the promotion of Packages through a workflow; manage storage of test results and application logs; manage the lifecycle of test Environments; provide a dashboard of test results with links to the underlying manifests, templates and, where appropriate, running Environments. The TCD test result dashboard is a multi-tenanted web application hosted and operated by Temenos. The dashboard shows historic test results for a Factory within a configured Release and trends through a web UI pulling data from the Assemble Modules local database and test results and application logs in Target Cloud storage. The TCD Artefact Repository is a third-party artefact repository “Artifactory by Jfrog” . The repository holds all the built software Components that are referenced by the Templates at the relevant test and deploy Stages. The Client will push all of its Product packages to the Artefact Repository"

Each time you login, you must accept the Privacy Notice in order to have access to the portal. The first page that is displayed after login is the Environments page where you can fill the date to create a New environment Fill the mandatory fields: Name Description Select an application from Cloud native applications Choose a template from Templates list Labels field is optional Click Create environment Note It will take about 15-20 minutes for the new environment to be created Create a User on the Portal This is required later when connecting to T24 through SFTP server connection, because it checks the authentication to the cloud environment with that specific user and the attached SSH key. To see all the steps regarding how to add a new user on the portal and to attach the SSH key, please see the following user guide about how to Create Users . Connect via SFTP Client In order to have access to the T24/ VM Cloud Application live folders, you can install an FTP client from https://winscp.net/eng/index.php Open WinSCP application and fill the mandatory fields: Host name > copy it from the environment endpoint: sftp.temenos.cloud (see image below) User name > input the exact name of the user added to the portal Click Advanced In the new screen, select SSH Authentication Upload the private key previously saved (corresponding to the public key attached to the portal user) Click OK Previous screen pops-up, click Login Check and Use Live Folders After logging in, on the right window, locate your environment ID Double click to access the live folders of the environment You will be able to see and access the following T24 live folders structure: default log_t24 standalone default - for example, here you can push a message file into the application that you need to test . Also into the default folder, you can create a folder and add some files to it, if you need them to do some specific actions. The folder you create/ add is supposed to point to the T24_HOME location. See below: how to find which is the T24_HOME path. how to point to the T24_HOME path in order to get the response that you need for your application. Find the T24_HOME path: Go to your environment on the portal Click on MONITOR APPLICATION Login with your credentials (these will be provided by Temenos) Then click on tdiag (the path will look similar to this: https://t24-1xxxxxxxxxxxxo.dev.temenos.cloud/TAFJEE/tDiag ) the xxx part represents your environment's id Scroll down a bit until you get to \" TAFJ Runtime properties \" section Here you can see: temn.tafj.runtime.directory.current /opt/rh/eap7/root/usr/share/wildfly/default If for example, you need to create a folder into the default location (/temenossftp/*yourorgid/your id/yourenvid /default) named \"demo\" then, in the T24 area the appropriate path will be **/opt/rh/eap7/root/usr/share/wildfly/default/demo *. Point to the T24_HOME path: Into the newly added folder (on default location), make sure you create a configuration file in which you set also the path to your folder. If for example you want to see a specific log for your application, you will be able to see this log into the log_t24 folder (see below more details). In order to do so, make sure you add a log4j.properties file into the same folder (the newly created) where you specify the path for the logs of your app. EXAMPLE: log4j.appender.FileLog.file=/opt/rh/eap7/root/usr/share/wildfly/modules/com/temenos/tafj/main/log_T24/your_app.log log_t24 - contains the T24.log files and also your como logs files when you run TSAs como - it will load TSA logs when running different TSA services T24.log - refers to the T24 BrowserWeb processes standalone - contains the jboss logs server.log - shows the Jboss application log (standalone folder appeas only for the Extend Templates, Wildfly Template and Stack01 Template). On the other hand, if you download the Stack02 Template instead of 'standalone' you will find the 'appserver' folder which shows WebSphere logs such as startServer.log, stopServer.log, and SystemOut.log To understand better how the SFTP connection works, check below schema: To see how you can push a message to be processed by an application, check this FCM example .

    "keywords": "Create new application endpoint This document can be used by technical staff who need to add new endpoints to the T24 application of a Environment in case of adding any custom endpoints or deploying a plugin in the application server of the Environment. Note This guide presumes that an Environment is already created and available. (In this example, we have created a Environment named DevEnv). Four properties are mandatory to create a new endpoint: (Please note that the user guide contains examples on how to use each of the properties). Property Name Property Description Endpoint Description The Endpoint Description will be displayed in your Organisation Portal in the Endpoints section of the T24 application from your Environment. Endpoint URL The Endpoint URL will be: * opened in a new tab of your browser when the Endpoint Description is clicked, if the Endpoint type is clickable. * copied if the Endpoint type is copyable. * downloaded , if the Endpoint type is a downloadable. Endpoint Type In order to apply above actions, a type must be defined for each endpoint, based on how you want to be used: clickable, copyable or downloadable. -For clickable endpoints is mandatory to add another parameter, Endpoint Append , which can have two values: true - it indicates if the endpoint is a real URL. false - it indicates if it must be appended to T24 URL. - For copyable endpoints is mandatory to have the same endpoint description and endpoint URL (Your_Endpoint_Description = Your_Endpoint_URL). Note The URL must be of type: \"https://........\" . As a reference, if you want to insert an endpoint which links to your environment browser web, please check the related URL - for example: https://t24-xxxxxxxxxxxx.temenos.cloud/BrowserWeb/ ) In order to create new endpoints for the T24 application of your Environment, the next steps must be followed: Clone the GitLab repository of your Environment in your local machine. For more details on how to clone a repository, check this page . Create a file with .endpoint extension inside plugins folder of the cloned repository as in the bellow picture. The name of the file is not important, but it should be relevant for your requirement. Inside the .endpoint file, add a new line for each endpoint with the structure Your_Endpoint_Description~Your_Endpoint_URL~Your_Endpoint_Type , as per bellow picture: Note \" ~ \" character is used as a separator between Endpoint Description, URL and Type and it must always be present in each endpoint line. Endpoint Description and URL are as per your choice. Type must be one of the options: clickable , copyable or downloadable . After creating and editing the .endpoint file, commit the file to the GitLab repository of your Environment. (In this example we have used TortoiseGit to commit and push the endpoint file - Command: Git Commit ->\"master\") Go to your environment to the portal and click the deploy button under the Repository. Wait until the .endpoint file is deployed in your Environment and check the Endpoints section of the T24 application as below: Add multiple endpoints from a single file If a plugin has more than one endpoint, create a .endpoint file and add a separate line for each endpoint item, as below: After the file is deployed, all 4 endpoints from the example are displayed in the Endpoints section of the T24 application. Also note that the endpoints are displayed/ grouped by their type: clickable, copyable and downloadable. Add multiple endpoints from multiple files at the same time If you want to add endpoints for multiple plugins deployed in your Environment, you can add the endpoints of all plugins in a single file or you can also create a separate .endpoint file for each plugin for a better delimitation. After both files are deployed, the three endpoints for plugin1 and the two endpoints for plugin2 are displayed in the Endpoints section of the T24 application. Update/Remove endpoints If you want to update endpoints that were already added to an application, you just have to update the required endpoint line from the .endpoint file, commit the file to the GitLab repository of your Environment and after the file is deployed, the required endpoint will be updated in the Endpoints section of your Application. If you want to remove endpoints that were already added to an application, you just have to remove the required endpoint line from the .endpoint file, commit the file to the GitLab repository of your Environment and after the file is deployed, only the endpoints available in the .endpoint file will be displayed in the Endpoints section of your Application. Also, to remove all the endpoints from a .endpoint file do not remove/ delete the file , but remove all the endpoints lines inside the file (empty the file). Note To summarize, the list of plugin endpoints displayed in the Endpoints section for an application is updated based on the content of .endpoint files available in the plugins folder from the GitLab repository of your Environment. If no .endpoint files are available in the GitLab repository of your Environment, then no plugin endpoints will be displayed."

This is the path where the components' files should be uploaded as explained on the next steps: (Please note that the components' artifacts can be uploaded any time before running a factory). (If the related artifacts are not uploaded, running the factory will not be possible and an error message will be thrown). Select single or multi depending on the number of archives you need to add, drag and drop or select the archive and then click deploy . You will see a success message and the archive under your component. Note Components artifacts are delivered to clients by Temenos Distribution team. Also the binaries/ artifacts have to be uploaded each time a component is updated. Which Components to Add In order to know which are the minimum required components that you need to add, you must first check the Templates Catalog (see button on the left menu). From here, select the template that you want to use: Make sure you select first the Template Type (FCM, T24, Tools, Wealth etc.). Then from the available Templates Catalog, select the one that you need in order to check the components. Under Full Template Content, scroll until you see the components section. Note: Usually there are at least two components sections: one related to T24 and another one refers to Model Bank Database (or other db). Depending on the template type, there could be more components, so please make sure you scroll down to check entirely the template in order to add all required components. It is required to add at least all the mandatory components. In addition to the mandatory components, you will need to add those components you need to test - not related to your selected template. For all added components, make sure you add the related files archive into the artifactory as explained above. Delete a Component Components fields are not editable, so you have only the options to create or to delete them. Note If your component is attached to a Product , you will not be able to delete it. You need first to delete the product, then return to the component and click Delete button. Products – Feature Description A product is a logical grouping of several components.

Templates customization will allow changes related to: the environment applications (i.e. the scripts to install and configure each application and the information displayed in the Portal for each application); the VM specifications in which each application is deployed. Note This guide presumes that a environment is already created and available under an Organisation for which the templates customization functionality is allowed. Boost your environment To start customizing your environment built using a Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform template, login to Temenos Continuous Deployment platform using your organisation user, go to your environment page and click on the Boost button attached to Repository application. After clicking the Boost button, you will receive a notification message - 'Customize your scripts' - referring to this user guide and agreeing with the action. The message 'Repository boosting initiated!\" appears on the screen and the status of Repository application is changed to Boosting , as per bellow picture. The operation triggered by the Boost button will copy in environment repository all the template files used to create the environment. Note Click the Refresh button to see when boosting action is completed. Also below the environment description, following message is displayed \"Scripts are customized for this environment.\" and the button Save as a new template appears. Repository structure after Boost As stated above, the Boost operation will make changes to environment repository. The difference between the before and after boost environment repository versions is represented by the presence of environments folder, as it can be observed bellow. Please check also the following user guide to see how to clone an environment locally and see the below repository structure. The structure of the environments folder is represented by 4 folders (found under common folder) : extraPlays infra-templates playbooks roles Note Depending on the template type (Extend or Assemble), the extraPlays folder may be or may not be present. To check the template type, go to Templates Catalog button on the left side menu and check the template used for your environment. If it contains the Components section, it means this is an Assemble template type and the extraPlays folder will be present after boost action. Important Depending on the template type (Extend or Assemble), the infra-templates and roles folders content may differ. For example: -- for extend templates, to change h2db role you need to change main.yml file from common/roles/h2/tasks/ -- for assemble templates to change h2db role you need to change deploy_main.yml file from common/roles/h2db/tasks/ The description of each folder is presented bellow: Folder Name Folder Description extraPlays This folder yml configuration files related to the template used in the creation of the environment. infra-templates This folder contains an infratemplate.yml file that describes the template of your environment (i.e. information related to the applications that are installed in your environment and VM specifications in which environment applications are deployed.). playbooks This folder contains a playbook.yml file that describes the set of roles that will be installed for each host(VM) defined under [services][servers] component in infratemplate.yml file. roles This folder contains all the roles defined for your template. A role represents any of your environment applications or it can be a module/plugin/framework that is required for your environment applications. A role is described by the following folders: defaults - contains default variables for the role. files - contains the files which are deployed using this role. handlers - contains handlers that are used by this role. meta - defines meta data for this role. tasks - contains the list of tasks that is executed for this role. templates - contains templates that can be deployed using this role. vars - contains the role variables. Note A role definition must include at least one of the above folders. Thus, any unused folders can be excluded. However, any in use folder must include a main.yml file that contains the relevant information, respectively a deploy_main.yml file in case of assemble templates.. Note Ansible automation tool is used by the Cloud Platform to automate environment creation based on applications with specific requirements and installation steps. For more details about Ansible, please access this link . Start template customization After boosting your environment, meaning that your environment repository contains all the folders and files related to your environment template, you can start the customization. There are several ways in which you can customize your environment template based on the type of your change. Note All the changes that must be implemented to a cloud environment template can be done only in environment repository . Thus, environment repository must be cloned in your local machine. For more information about how to clone an environment repository, please check this page . Changes that will require the rebuild of your environment : Note The rebuild operation will take around 20 minutes and it will recreate all environment resources (VMs) and run the deployment of all roles defined in environment template. To trigger the rebuild of your environment, login to the portal using your organisation user, go to your environment page and click on the Rebuild button attached to your environment main application. Changes related to applications that will be installed under your environment. The applications list is defined in [services][servers] component from infratemplate.yml file located in /environments/common/infra-templates folder of environment repository. An example of a template with 2 applications (t24 & h2) is presented bellow. -> If an application must be removed from the default application list of the template, then the corespondent item must be removed from [services][servers] component and the item related to the application must be removed from playbook.yml file from /environments/common/playbooks folder. -> If an application must be added to the default application list of the template, then a new item must be added in [services][servers] component. After this, a new role must be created for this application in /environments/common/roles folder of environment repository and playbook.yml file from /environments/common/playbooks must be updated with a new item for the new application. Changes related to applications information (name, description, etc.) displayed in the Portal. Each environment application has a related item in [services][servers] component from infratemplate.yml file. Please check the description of each key (e.g. app_name , app_description , etc.) in infratemplate.yml file in order to understand which information appear in the Portal. Changes related to VM specifications in which environment applications are deployed. The VM specifications on which each environment application is deployed are defined in [provider][azure][config] component from infratemplate.yml file. [server_size] key defines the VM specifications that will be applied for all applications defined in [services][servers] component. If different VM specifications must be applied to each environment application, then [server_size] key must be set in [services][servers] component for each application. The detailed VM specifications can be viewed here . Note After making the required changes, commit and push them to your environment repository and trigger the rebuild. To make sure there are no syntax erros in the updated infratemplate.yml file, you can use this online validator . Changes that will require the deployment of your environment : Note The deployment operation will take around 5 minutes or more depending on your changes. To trigger the deployment of your environment, login to the cloud portal using your organisation user, go to your environment page and click on the Deploy button attached to Repository application. Changes related to roles already present in template. (i.e. an environment is already created with this template) If an already present role must be updated (for example, the tasks list for a role must be updated), make the required changes for that role, commit and push the changes to the environment repository and trigger the deployment. Changes related to roles tha represent a module/plugin/framework and not an application. New roles that represent a module/plugin/framework and not an application can be added to an application of your environment. In order to accomplish this, a new role along its settings must be created in /environments/common/roles folder and the new role must be added to the specific application in playbook.yml file from /environments/common/playbooks folder. After this, push all these changes to environment repository and trigger the deployment. Changes that are not related to environment template. For the changes described here that are not related to environment template, you just have to commit and push the required changes to your environment repository and trigger the deployment. Note If the deployment operation is not successful for your changes, please rebuild the environment. The cloud portal catalogue of available templates can be checked here . <!-- <br /><span style=\"font-size:20px\">text</span> --> Save New Template After doing the above steps (template customization), go to Save as a new template button and fill the required fields, as in the example below: You will see a message on the screen \"Environment saved as a new template\".

Buttons : Starting an environment: After creating an environment, the Start button is automatically disabled as the environment is running. It will be enabled if an environment is stopped and it will start all the instances specified in the Environment configuration. When the environment is stopped, start button is supposed to start the VMs where the database and the application server of a T24 environment are installed and also to start the application server (jboss, wildfly, WebSphere, etc.) so that T24 to be up and running. However, please note that start button is not triggering also the deployment of whatever is present into the associated Git repository (like something that was committed when the environment was stopped or a T24 update package ( L1 development) that was not yet successfully deployed to the T24 area). Stopping an environment: Stops all running instances of an Application in an Environment. Rebuilding an environment: It recreates the resourses into the cloud and re-installs T24 and H2 db. This is used for example when modifying the application templates (like changing the T24 displayed name or addign a new application). Exporting an environment: Allows to export and import an environment or a database through SFTP server. Clicking the 'Export Environment' button will generate a zip file on the sftp.temenos.cloud portal containing: all jar files deployed in T24 sandbox and the correspondent module.xml file; the content of the default folder of T24; all war files deployed in the T24 sandbox and the jboss server log. Database section - available actions Buttons : Exporting the database: By clicking the \"Export database\" button a zip file will be generated in the sftp.cloud.temenos portal which will contain the current database of the sandbox. Note: This database can be used as a backup that can be deployed later on into the sandbox as a duplicate for testing/development or for local development before deploying to the cloud. Endpoints : tcdSFTP.temenos.cloud - allows you to copy the SFTP link. Repository section - available actions Buttons : Boosting Used to apply the changes made to the environments' repository (you can modify the infra-templates, the playbooks or the roles). Deploying To be used when deploying newly added plugins, endpoints, updates, web services, packages etc. Endpoints : This section displays the gitlab repository correspondent to your T24 sandbox that you can copy it in order to clone the repository. example: git@tcdGitlab.temenos.cloud:1dyomzt4lxuyo/corebanking.git Note IMPORTANT! As a good practice and in terms of reducing your costs, it is recommended that you don't keep an environment unused . Even if it's not used, it will still generate costs. The environment will be deleted by the Extend team (with a previous mail notification) when it is unused for more than 3 days (for internal clients), respectively for more than 7 days (for external clients). Also to reduce costs, the environment can be put on Stop and started only when required. The environments that are stopped will not be deleted."

Login to your organization on the TCD (Temenos Continuous Deployment) portal ( https://portal.temenos.cloud/ ), ( https://tcd-portal.temenos.cloud/ ) read and accept the privacy notice. Create an Environment Once logged, go to the Environments tab on the left and then click New environment button on the right. Fill Name and Description fields. Select T24 from Cloud Native Applications (dropdown list). And then choose a T24 template with the version that you need (in current example R18.11). Labels field is optional . Click Create button. Wait about 15-20 minutes to see the action completed and to have your environment available. Note To see how to create an environment, please also check this user guide. Note For this user guide, there are two environments created: DevEnv DevEnv1 They will be used to see how to export the DB from one environment and import it into the other one. Add a User to the Portal Go to Users tab and click New user Fill all required fields Make sure you attach an SSH key to the user created, as it is required when exporting and importing the database. Note This user can be used on both environments (DevEnv and DevEnv1). Check this user guide to see how to create a user on the portal and attach a SSH key. Change a record into the Database (for demo purposes) Note This section is just an example and it can be skipped. The only purpose is to prove that the export and import of the database has been done correctly by showing that a changed record from a source environment can be retrieved in another environment (where the source environment database has been imported). Go to your environment Connect to T24 browser (Click Go to Application ) And login to T24 with your user and password: (Please note that first login will be slower) Amend a customer record Go to User Menu > Customer > Amend Customer In the new screen, type a customer number from your db (ex. 190094) and click Find Then click amend button Change the GB Town/City from the Physical Address tab and then press Commit the deal button in order to save the change. ( Note : You can do any change on any record type) Two notifications about Customer's documents will pop up > Mark them as ' Received ' and Click \" Accept Overrides \" > Transaction is complete The next step is to authorize the record change: Log out and login with a different user (in production, this user will have special rights) Go to User Menu > Customer > click Authorise/ Delete Customer menu Click authorise button ( double-check ) > The screen is expanded with the details of the customer > Click again authorise Export the Database In case you want to export and re-import the database into an environment or do some changes and import it back or to a different environment, please follow the steps below: To trigger the export, click the Export button under Database (also confirm the action on the pop-up to be able to proceed). After clicking, it will start exporting (the action should take less than a minute or more minutes based on the DB size). While exporting, the button is disabled, after the export is done, the button gets enabled back. Note Please note that the same steps showed in this demo can be followed to export an environment. Start exporting by using the Export button (check the available buttons under T24 Release). During this action, the db is exported through SFTP server to which you have to connect in order to download the related content on your local machine. Download WinSCP from here . Open WinSCP and create a new site which will allow the connection through SFTP server: For host name, use the endpoint of the db. (You can copy it from your portal by clicking the copy icon near the endpoint of the database - 'sftp.temenos.cloud'). For the user name, put the PaaS user name that you have created on the portal. (Check Users tab to see the available users). Instead of password, click Advanced A new screen is open Choose SSH > Authentication > and browse for the private key related to your portal user > click OK. After attaching the SSH key, click on save button – here we can give a site name that we want for future use. Previous screen will appear - click login to connect to the SFTP server. It will search for host and connect to it. A successful connection will display two sides as follows: On the left side - the location from your local machine where the db will be downloaded. On the right side - the location of the exported db on the SFTP server; the DB is saved in the folder with the organization id and environment id ( /organisationID/environmentID folder structure ). The database appears as TAFJDB.zip. In order to download the zip, select it and press F5. After is being downloaded, you can unzip it to see the db file. After this step, you can close the SFTP connection: Session > Disconnect. Clone the Target Environment For each Environment there is a Repository associated to it. This repository needs to be cloned locally and then the database will be pushed into it. Next step is to deploy it to the Temenos Cloud target environment (DevEnv1 in current example). To be able to clone, you need to have a GUI Git Client installed on your local machine. Example: Tortoise Git Also, during cloning, it will be necessary to attach the private ssh key related to your portal user. (If needed, please check this user guide). Login to your environment on the portal, locate the endpoint of the repository and copy it by selecting it OR clicking the icon on the right. Create a folder on your computer (you can place it anywhere on your local machine). In this example is named 'GitDemo' Click right inside the folder and choose Git Clone (this command belongs to TortoiseGit) In the screen that opens, fill the following: in the URL textbox, paste the Endpoint of Repository Application of your Environment (previously copied) the Directory textbox to your local repository folder should be automatically determined as current folder location load the private key (this is the private key corresponding to the public key of your portal user) click OK The content is downloaded from the repository of your environment to your computer, displaying a success message if the cloning was correct. You will be able to see the corebanking repository structure with several folders like: addons, client_files, packages, plugins, updates, wsdl etc. The TAFJDB.zip must be placed into client_files > h2db folder: Note In case you made changes to the db file, please make sure you archive it as a ZIP and rename it as TAFJDB - capital letters are case sensitive - before pushing it into the repository). Also note that this procedure will replace the existing database in the cloud with this one. The old database will be lost, including any records loaded manually. Commit and Push the DB Click right inside the h2db folder and choose Git commit master , check the not versioned files that you want to push (in this case TAFJDB.zip), put a comment in the box, then commit and push. After the success message, close the box. Deploy DB and Check the Change Go back to the portal to the target environment and click the Deploy button under the Repository After the deployment is done, you can check the change of the database as follows: Click Go to Application to open a T24 Browser Login with your T24 user and password Under User Menu, go to Customer > Individual Customer > More Actions > Search Live File (from dropdown arrow) and click Go The searched record is displayed > Click on the search/selection button on the left > The GB Town Country line should be changed into Portland confirming the correct import of the database"

    "title": "Factories",
    "keywords": "Factories Factories are the core Assemble components that define how, what and when to deploy, test and promote the various components used by an organization. A factory is an information bundle that holds the following critical information that is needed to run an assembly factory: Name Used just to identify or tag a factory Products a. Principle Products – Principle products simply mean the list of components that are being tested against a stable set of other pre-tested components. After successfully running the factory, the principle products are promoted to the next stage (the configured one). b. Other products (Base Products) – Products that are pre-tested (by other factories) and are known to be stage. These are products that don’t need to be promoted but they are required to test the Principle Products. Stages a. From stage (Which stage to get the principle components from) – Source stage (The stage from which pre-tested stable components can be picked up). b. Source Stage – The stage from which the “Other Products” (Base Products) components are fetched. This stage represents a stable version of components that is pre-tested from the perspective of the current factory. c. Target Stage - The stage to which components are promoted if the assembly successfully tests the list of components Templates a. Environment Template - holds the details of the template that is to be used to deploy the components selected by the factory b. Test Template – specifies the template that is required to deploy a test environment that holds the testing framework and test scripts. This is needed to generalize the test tools as a template. WebHooks a. Success Webhook – This is just a simple callback mechanism that can be utilized by the owner of a factory to callback another API if the factory successfully runs. b. Failure Webhook – Same as Success Webhooks. But are called when the factory fails. Validations The list of selected products cannot contain components that are not understood by the selected Environment Template. a. The list of components contained in the principle and other products needs to match a bare minimum of all mandatory components specified in the template. b. The list of components can possibly have more than one component of the same type if the template allows more than one count of the same type. c. The list of components cannot contain a component type that is unknown to the Template. Webhooks – The webhooks need to be valid URLs and can only get called with GET method. Templates – The selection of templates are restricted based on the type of the template and a selection list is already confined to allocated and valid templates. Stages – No restriction. The factory can even choose to use the same Stage for all three stage values. Note See below configurations to understand better how to configure correctly and the factory's behavior. How to Set-up/ Edit/ Delete Factories Set-up/ Create a Factory Click on Settings button on the main menu on the left. Make sure you select first the Stream and Stage (this is the stage where components are promoted) where you want to create a factory and then click New Factory button on the top-right. Fill the required fields (see all definitions above and also below example). All fields are mandatory except the last three (Base Products, Success Webhook and Failure Webhook) . Name : choose a meaningful name for your factory. Description : put a description that will help knowing what the factory is about. Templates : choose an Environment Template from the dropdown list. Based on this template will be created the environments where you will be able to test different products. Test Environment Template : this is a defaulted test tool available on the Platform in order to be able to run your tests on the Platform interface. Based on the Environment release you should choose the related Test Template. Source Stage : this is the stage with the stable version of components. Base Stage : this is the stage with the constituent components. When testing the first time, you can choose the same stage for source and base to make sure everything is promoted successfully. Principle Products - these are promoted to the next stage and belong under Source Stage. Base Products - these are products that don’t need to be promoted but they are required to test the Principle Products and they belong under the Base Stage. Click Create button > the factory is successfully created. Edit a Factory Click the Edit button. Any field can be changed/ edited as long as the entire Factory configuration complies with the validation rules. Click the Update button. Delete a Factory You can easily delete a factory by clicking the delete button. The products, stages and streams created before can be re-used."

The 'Build pipeline' job builds the artifacts and deploys them into the test environment. Once the testing is successful and it's ready for promotion, the 'Promote pipeline' deploys the tested artifacts into the integrated dev environment. For this tutorial, we will be integrating Jenkins with GitLab (or Bitbucket - depending on your repository) so that Jenkins can pull the code and build artifacts. Main steps Merge the team changes to existing code​. Run the integrated build​. Deploy the changes to a Integrated DEV Environment​. Continue with the existing flow. To implement the Pipeline as a code we will use Jenkins Pipeline in order to automate tasks associated with building, testing and deploying software. Access Development Portal Sign into one of the following URLs (choose the link you have been provided with): https://portal.temenos.cloud or https://tcd-portal.temenos.cloud/ using the credentials provided by Temenos (Username and Password): Create the required environments Fill the following parameters and press 'Create environment' : • Name • Description • Template • Labels (optional) Fill the required fields and press Create . Note It might take about 15-20 minutes to create an environment. Note You will need to create following three environments: • A build environment with the required template ( in our example is \"BuildResources-Jenkins-Jfrog-R18.11\" ) • A source environment with the required template ( in our example is \"Retail Suite R18.11\" ) • A target environment with the same template as the last one. Login to Jenkins After the \"BuildServices\" environment has been created, click on it and go to Jenkins Dashboard: In the new screen, click Login button on the top-right corner: Sign in with user admin and password changeit Note After first login, you will need to change the password. Change the password Click on 'Admin' button on top-right corner and then, on the left side, click on 'Configure' button Input a new password, confirm it, click 'Apply' and then 'Save' Note In case of a coffee break during the Jenkins configuration, the session may expire. Make sure when you come back that you are still logged or login again. Build pipeline workflow Build Pipeline works based on pipeline script (Jenkins file). Requirements: It requires valid credentials to pull the code from your GitLab (or Bitbucket) repository (or a different repository that will be made available). Users need to add credentials to clone the git repositories. For setting up credentials please refer to below section \"Add SSH keys inside Jenkins\" Steps during build: Pulls the code from the Gitlab (or Bitbucket) repository Builds the artifacts using DS binaries Deploys the artifacts in the TEST environments Generate SSH key This section explains how to add the credentials in order to clone the Git repositories. The Jenkins Server requires a Source code repository, which will be taken from Github repository (or another kind of repository that you have), then a Development environment and a Test environment. The dependencies between all of them are done through the ssh keys. The SSH key is used to authenticate between the Jenkins server and the environments. The keys solve different problems such as: user identification, security/ privacy and continuos integration and delivery best practices First, you will need a SSH key, which can be generated by using PuTTY: As instructed on PuTTY screen, move the mouse over the blank area to generate the key. PRIVATE KEY After the key is generated, go to Conversions tab and choose Export OpenSSH key (force new file format) PUBLIC KEY Click on Save private key button Later during Jenkins configurations, it will be necessary to use these SSH keys. To use the public key, you need to click right on the key saved (.ppk format) and select Edit with PuTTYgen Add user to the portal Go to portal.temenos.cloud , respectively https://tcd-portal.temenos.cloud/ . Click on New user And fill the required fields Note Copy-paste the entire public key generated before and press Create user Don't forget to click Save private key from PuTTY Key Generator in order to save the private key that you may use later. Add a second user to the portal The same as for the first user added, first make sure you generated a new SSH key and then: Go to portal.temenos.cloud , respectively https://tcd-portal.temenos.cloud/ . Click on New user And fill the required fields Note Copy-paste the entire public key generated before and press Create Don't forget to click Save private key from PuTTY Key Generator in order to save the private key that you may use later. Add SSH key to GitLab repository We are using GitLab repository, but you can use a different one. In this repository you have to add the ssh keys for the users created in order to connect to Jenkins and build resources. The users created into the https://portal.temenos.cloud/ will be automatically added in the Gitlab repo. Log into GitLab ( https://staging-gitlab.temenos.cloud/admin ) as an admin and follow below steps: Click on the key for admin area: Go to users tab. Search the users created ( example: cristina ) and press enter. In case the user is not automatically added (due to a different platform use), please go to New user button and add the required users. Click on the user name and then on the edit button on the right. Set a password of minimum 8 chars and repeat password for confirmation, then Save changes. Logout from admin menu and login with the new user and the password set before. Change user password: Once you login, you will notice that it will be required automatically to setup a new password (Input your current password > Set a new password > Confirm it > Click Set new password After this step you will be automatically logged out and you need to login again with the new password Click on the user icon on the top-right corner and select 'Settings' Go to SSH Keys tab and paste the public key that you generated before as follows: paste the entire public key > you will notice that the Title field is automatically completed with the last part of the key ( rsa-key-20180731 ) delete the last part until equal sign and press Add key Repeat the same steps from this section ('Add SSH key to GitLab repository') for the second portal user that you created. Add user to your Gitlab project You also need to add the created user to your project and give full access: Note Repeat the same steps below also for the other user created in the portal Login back as an admin and go to admin area ( use settings button ) Click on Projects tab Then find your project Then Manage access on the right Then find your member (user), select Master from dropdown list to give full permission for this user and then Add to project Add credentials and Use ID from 'Temenos-DS-R18.11-Demo' Project Go back to your organisation on TCD portal, click on BuildServices environment and access from there the Jenkins Dashboard.
