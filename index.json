How to create Users The Administrator can navigate to the Users section on the portal, create more users and invite them to access and use the portal using the URL link. In this way the administrator is in control of who receives the URL link and which users can access the Organisation. The users can access their organisation only, view their user profiles and perform various operations according to the set of user permissions set by the Organisation Administrator. Note that only the users with the 'Admin' permission can create more users. To manage/ see the users please refer to the below: • Login to your organisation portal using the link and the credentials provided. Go to the menu on the left and then click Users tab, as below: Click on the Users tab To order the users' list hover over the Name tab - the users will be listed in an alphabetical order Click on the Status tab to see the status of each user (i.e. the user status can be creating, editing, failed, deleting ) Create a new user by clicking the New user button on the top-right corner. Fill in the username, email, password and the user role (the SSH Key can be added later on if needed). Click Create This will create a new user in your organisation. This new user will be automatically assigned to all GitLab Repositories from within all environments. If you have already a user created, you can click on the user and update the SSH key box with the one created above. Important! : It is the Organisation Admin's responsibility to inform the new user about its credentials and set of permissions granted on the portal. Change Password To change the password you need to follow the next steps: Click on your user name (top-right) Click on Profile Click on Change Password Fill in the Current Password , New Password and Confirm Password and click Confirm Note: on your first login, you need to reset the password that was initially created by the Organisation Admin. Recover Password Ask the Organisation Admin to change your password If you lost your password, your Organisation Admin can change it from his/ her end. To do this, the Organiation Admin needs to: Click on the User tab from the left menu and select the user Click on Change Password Fill in the New Password and Confirm Password fields, then click Confirm Note: upon login with the password set by the organisation admin, you need to reset your password. Raise a support ticket If you have forgotten or lost your password, you can recover it by contacting the below: If your Org is on a PROD platform contact us at CloudPlatformSupport@temenos.com If your Org is on a EU or TSS platform contact the Global Cloud Platform Support team (gcp@temenos.com) Update SSH Key To Update the SSH Key, follow the instructions below: Click on your user name (top-right) and then on Profile Click Edit SSH Do the necessary changes and click on Update SSH / if no changes are required click Cancel Note: the Update SHH button is enabled once the editing is started and the number of characters added in the field are over 200. User Roles Management By default, when your organisation is created, Temenos will provide you the link and access instructions to your designated organisation administrator (the first and only user with full rights on the platform). Click on the Roles tab to see the available list of roles within your organisation Hover over the Name tab to display the alphabetical order of the available roles Select the number of items you'd like to have listed on the page (this is applicable for the users' tab as well) The administrator can create more users and navigate to the Roles section on the portal to assign various permissions to each user. To create a role, click on New Role on top-right and fill in the blanks: The admin can select which permissions to set to each user. Once the role is created, the admin can assign it to a specific user: go to the Users tab and select the user choose from the drop-down list the user click Edit on the user choose from the drop-down list the role that needs to be assigned To understand what which of the permission does, hover the cursor over the variables and a short description will pop up or click here to get an overview of the permissions. For security reasons, if you are inactive for more than 5 minutes on the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform a dialog box pop up prompts on the screen in the last minute of your inactive session which asks to choose whether you want to extend the session or logout. By clicking Extend your session will still be active If you opt to Logout or don’t take any action on the pop-up your session will expire. Note that the environment creation, factory runs or other organization operations will still be running. The session is automatically extended when the you click on the Overview or Events tabs in the environments details page. How to use PuTTY SSH client for SSH key generation. If you need access to the source code repository you must provide the public SSH Keys on the user profile section to gain access. You can use any other SSH key generator client. Note If you already have installed a SSH key generator client, you can skip this step. • Download the installer from http://www.putty.org/ • Run the installer and click Next on each screen, without changing anything in configurations. Click Finish once completed. How to create the SSH keys (pair public and private keys) • Open PuTTYgen and click Generate button: • This creates a new SSH key by moving the mouse in the blank area (highlighted in red), as per bellow picture. • After PuTTYgen has finished the key generation, you can save your public key/private key in any location from your local machine. Note In order to have a valid SSH key that can be recognized by Infrastructure, do not use the Save public key button from PuTTygen and just select the whole public key from the PuTTYgen screen and save it in your local machine. • From the PuTTYgen screen you must also save the private key. Press the Save private key button, choose 'Yes' on the next prompt (save the key without a passphrase to protect it) and indicate a name and location for the private key. • The public/private key location on your local machine should look like this: How to add users on the portal with the SSH keys Note All fields are mandatory! See further below how to generate the SSH key • Public SSH key needs to be pasted in SSH Key text box. Open Windows Explorer and locate your public key generated using PuTTY Key Generator. • Right click and open it with notepad. Select all and copy to clipboard. • Paste the copied text into the SSH Key text box and click Create user button. Your user is now available in the user list. You have the option to edit or to delete it. Note Once created, you cannot change the name and the email address, nor the user's password. You can only update (or add) the SSH key through edit button. Your username will be created in Gitlab server and public SSH key provided will be added to your account being accessible from all the environments created in your organisation. For further details or issues related to Gitlab SSH keys usage, or other operating systems (MAC, Linux), please consult this link: [https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/]( To see the details of a user please make sure to first select the user from the left-side users list: User Permissions Required To be able to create a user the below permission needs to be enabled for your user: CREATE _ USER To have a better understanding of the user permissions, hover the cursor over the variables and a short description will pop up or click here to read more."

    "keywords": "Add new endpoints to an environment This document can be used by technical staff who need to add new endpoints to the T24 application of a Environment in case of adding any custom endpoints or deploying a plugin in the application server of the Environment. Note This guide presumes that an Environment is already created and available. (In this example, we have created a Environment named DevEnv). Four properties are mandatory to create a new endpoint: (Please note that the user guide contains examples on how to use each of the properties). Property Name Property Description Endpoint Description The Endpoint Description will be displayed in your Organisation Portal in the Endpoints section of the T24 application from your Environment. Endpoint URL The Endpoint URL will be: * opened in a new tab of your browser when the Endpoint Description is clicked, if the Endpoint type is clickable. * copied if the Endpoint type is copyable. * downloaded , if the Endpoint type is a downloadable. Endpoint Type In order to apply above actions, a type must be defined for each endpoint, based on how you want to be used: clickable, copyable or downloadable. -For clickable endpoints is mandatory to add another parameter, Endpoint Append , which can have two values: true - it indicates if the endpoint is a real URL. false - it indicates if it must be appended to T24 URL. - For copyable endpoints is mandatory to have the same endpoint description and endpoint URL (Your_Endpoint_Description = Your_Endpoint_URL). Note The URL must be of type: \"https://........\" . As a reference, if you want to insert an endpoint which links to your environment browser web, please check the related URL - for example: https://t24-xxxxxxxxxxxx.temenos.cloud/BrowserWeb/ ) In order to create new endpoints for the T24 application of your Environment, the next steps must be followed: Clone the GitLab repository of your Environment in your local machine. For more details on how to clone a repository, check this page . Create a file with .endpoint extension inside plugins folder of the cloned repository as in the bellow picture. The name of the file is not important, but it should be relevant for your requirement. Inside the .endpoint file, add a new line for each endpoint with the structure Your_Endpoint_Description~Your_Endpoint_URL~Your_Endpoint_Type , as per bellow picture: Note \" ~ \" character is used as a separator between Endpoint Description, URL and Type and it must always be present in each endpoint line. Endpoint Description and URL are as per your choice. Type must be one of the options: clickable , copyable or downloadable . After creating and editing the .endpoint file, commit the file to the GitLab repository of your Environment. (In this example we have used TortoiseGit to commit and push the endpoint file - Command: Git Commit ->\"master\") Go to your environment to the portal and click the deploy button under the Repository. Wait until the .endpoint file is deployed in your Environment and check the Endpoints section of the T24 application as below: Add multiple endpoints from a single file If a plugin has more than one endpoint, create a .endpoint file and add a separate line for each endpoint item, as below: After the file is deployed, all 4 endpoints from the example are displayed in the Endpoints section of the T24 application. Also note that the endpoints are displayed/ grouped by their type: clickable, copyable and downloadable. Add multiple endpoints from multiple files at the same time If you want to add endpoints for multiple plugins deployed in your Environment, you can add the endpoints of all plugins in a single file or you can also create a separate .endpoint file for each plugin for a better delimitation. After both files are deployed, the three endpoints for plugin1 and the two endpoints for plugin2 are displayed in the Endpoints section of the T24 application. Update/Remove endpoints If you want to update endpoints that were already added to an application, you just have to update the required endpoint line from the .endpoint file, commit the file to the GitLab repository of your Environment and after the file is deployed, the required endpoint will be updated in the Endpoints section of your Application. If you want to remove endpoints that were already added to an application, you just have to remove the required endpoint line from the .endpoint file, commit the file to the GitLab repository of your Environment and after the file is deployed, only the endpoints available in the .endpoint file will be displayed in the Endpoints section of your Application. Also, to remove all the endpoints from a .endpoint file do not remove/ delete the file , but remove all the endpoints lines inside the file (empty the file). Note To summarize, the list of plugin endpoints displayed in the Endpoints section for an application is updated based on the content of .endpoint files available in the plugins folder from the GitLab repository of your Environment. If no .endpoint files are available in the GitLab repository of your Environment, then no plugin endpoints will be displayed.

Below you will find the pre-requisites to run a Automated factory: Pre-requisites 1 stream 2 stages within the stream you created (learn how to create streams here ) a. Source Stage - the stage from which pre-tested stable components can be picked up b. Target Stage – the stage which will be provisioned during the factory run with the components from the Source Stage the list of mandatory components from the environment template (learn how to deploy the components here ) 2 products (learn how to create a product here ) a. Principle Products – Principle products simply mean the list of components that are being tested against a stable set of other pre-tested components. After successfully running the factory, the principle products are promoted to the next stage (the configured one). b. Other products (Base Products) – Products that are pre-tested (by other factories). These are products that don’t need to be promoted but they are required to test the Principle Products. 2 templates a. Environment Template - holds the details of the template that is to be used to deploy the components selected by the factory b. Test Template – specifies the template that is required to deploy a test environment that holds the testing framework. Validations The list of selected products cannot contain components that are not understood by the selected Environment Template. a. The list of components contained in the principle and other products needs to match a bare minimum of all mandatory components specified in the template. b. The list of components can possibly have more than one component of the same type if the template allows more than one count of the same type. c. The list of components cannot contain a component type that is unknown to the Template. Stages – No restriction. The factory can even choose to use the same Stage for all three stage values. During the factory setup all the mandatory fields need to be filled in the current tab. Otherwise you are not able to move to the next phases and the Next button is disabled. See below configurations to understand better how to configure correctly and the factory's behavior. Set-up/ Create a Automated Factory Click on Settings button on the main menu on the left. Make sure you select first the Stream and Stage (this is the stage where components are promoted) where you want to create a factory and then click New Factory button on the top-right. Fill the required fields (see all definitions above and also below example): Factory Details Add a Factory Name : choose a meaningful name for your factory. Add a Factory Description : insert a description that will help knowing what the factory is about. Click Next Product Configuration This tab represents the test configuration that holds the template, the products and the source stage that are pre-tested from the perspective of the current factory. Template : choose an Environment Template from the dropdown list. Based on this template the environments will be created where you will be able to test different products Select Principle Products : following a successful run, the principle products are promoted to the next stage (the configured one) Source Stage : this is the stage with the stable version of components Select Other Products : you can select more products that are required to test the Principle products click Next Test Configuration The Test Configuration consists in in-build service tasks and is used to trigger tests for a given factory-run, trigger export of application logs. Depending on your organisation settings, you may / may not have a Default Workflow or the option to select from a list of workflows defined by the users from your organisation. During this phase, you have to fill in the Workflow steps - a sample which displays the steps (in that exact sequence) that are executed by the selected workflow. Assuming that you select the Default Workflow , you need to fill in the following fields: Test template : specifies the template that is required to deploy a test environment that holds the testing framework and test scripts. This is needed to generalize the test tools as a template. Component : this is the component that holds the test scripts which runs against the T24 VM No. of VMs : number of test VM's to be created during factory run Test Stage: represents a stable version of components that is pre-tested from the perspective of the current factory Optional : tick if the workflow should stop in case of failure Click Next At the end of this step, when the first round of tests is completed, the test VM will be deleted, but it will not stop the T24 environment (this will be done at the end of the workflow) Assuming that you select a customized workflow with COB you need to fill in additional steps, such as: type in the ID of the TSA.SERVICE record for which COB has to be run. The ID can be either group specific ID (eg: COB-1, COB-001) , company specific ID (eg: COB-GB0010001) or COB. Important: currently the platform can handle 20 agents at max, including the online services. To get a better understanding of what happens when COB is triggered please refer to THIS user guide. Promotion Configuration This configuration enables the user to select all the required principle products along with the target stage to which they will be promoted after a successful factory run. In addition, the user can select the Test Components along with the target stage if they need promotion as well. Note It is not mandatory to fill in the Tests to Promote field and the associated Select target stage for Tests from the right side. Factory Scheduler A user has the privilege to configure the factory run schedule to automatically run the tests and have the results available daily. the scheduler can be configured to run one time per day if the factory run test is successful you can choose to stop, or keep running the T24 environment the same applies for the Factory Run Failure scenario The Stop Environment and Keep Running Environment options are aimed to be used for costs purposes To see the details of a factory first select the stream and the stage from the top-right-side menu.

    "keywords": "Components – Feature Description Components are individually deployable units that are understood by Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform based on the component type that each component refers to. Each component is associated to a component type to help Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform deploy the component. The Component Type field in the component data is the key to help the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform Controllers deploy the right components in the right way. An organization can define as many components as needed but should have all mandatory components defined in the templates that are assigned to the organization. Practically when a template is assigned to an organization, a list of component types related to that template is added for that organization. Each component has the following fields (all mandatory) : Component Type Name Description Display Name Component Type The platform uses a convention/ protocol to deploy all parts required to run a full-fledged instance of T24 (Or any other product supported by a template). Such parts to constitute a complete system are called components . The T24 installation may have the following components (No exhaustive or inclusive): T24-Jars T24-ud Helptext Tafj-installer etc. Each item in this list is called a component type . The names of these parts / Component Types are fixed and are not user editable. This is managed internally by the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform admin/ development group and can only be changed or modified by this group. Each component type represents a deployable unit and has an ansible script associated to it. These components have a structure associated and work in a standardized manner across different deployment stacks (OS, App server variations, DB variations etc). The components are sorted from A to Z and you are able to search/ filter the component by name. The list displays all the components available for your Organization. WARNING: make sure to follow the naming convention as defined by the Temenos team. Any adjustments to the components' title such as adding special characters or spaces will result in a failed factory run. Example: downloading the same file multiple times auto-numbers the file name from 1 onwards - t24-jars-63688104355895 (1) .zip and adds a space as well. Please use the .zip file that has the original title - t24-jars-63688104355895.zip . How to Set Up/ Delete Components Set-up/ Create a Component Login to the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform. Click on Settings button on the left menu > this will expand a menu containing buttons for: Streams, Stages, Products, Factory and General Select the Stream (top-right) where you want to add the respective component Click on New Components Select the Component Type from the dropdown list and fill in the Component Name , Component Description , and Component Display Name Click Create . See below example: A folder is automatically created into the repository (we are using JFrog Artifactory) with the name of your component and will be always created under the default CONFIGURATION_STAGE stage. This is the path where the components' files should be uploaded as explained on the next steps. (Please note that the components' artifacts can be uploaded any time before running a factory). (If the related artifacts are not uploaded, running the factory will not be possible and an error message will be thrown). To see the details of a component please make sure to first select the stream from the top-right-side menu. The list with the components that belong to the respective stream will be displayed on the left side of the page. The same operation applies for the products. How to login to Artifactory Every user created in the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform can log in with the platform’s credential on the Artifactory server as well. Follow the steps below to login to the Artifactory: go on the left-side menu on the portal and click on Metadata . here are the metadata settings: copy the Artifactory URL and open it in another browser. To login use with your credentials from the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform. This is how your Artifactory will be displayed: to see the artifactory repository, click on the Artifactory icon from the left-side menu. The repository belonging to your organisation will be displayed (to make sure you expand the right repository, always check the naming convention: repo-1dq4zcowcn75s1, where what follows after 'repo-' represents the ID of your organisation: How to upload binaries into the Artifactory The users are enabled to download the existing artifacts or upload new artifacts that will be used for factories. This process can be done in two ways: A. Manually access the artifactory and upload the required binary (recommended). Requirements: new user : it is mandatory for the user to have assigned a role which contains CREATE COMPONENT and MANAGE COMPONENTS permissions. existing user : if a user wants to log in to the Artifactory server, the user must change its password and have the CREATE COMPONENT and MANAGE COMPONENTS permissions within the role that was assigned to it. To learn how to change the user roles and permissions please refer to this link . Note for an already created user that wants to have access to the Artifactory Server, the user must change its password and if its role has those 2 permissions, the user will be added in Artifactory Server if the user’s role is updated afterwards , the user still needs to change its password in order to be added to the Artifactory Server the user cannot delete artifacts from the Artifactory Server. Select single or multi depending on the number of archives you need to add, drag and drop or select the archive and then click deploy . You will see a success message and the archive under your component. Note Components artifacts are delivered to clients by Temenos Distribution team. Also the binaries/ artifacts have to be uploaded each time a component is updated. B. Invoke an Artifactory API that will upload the required binary into the appropriate location. In order to invoke that Artifactory API a CURL command must be executed (this can be run manually from a linux VM or from a bash script). curl -H \"X-JFrog-Art-Api:<ArtifactoryKey>\" -X PUT \"<DestinationURL>\" -T <fileToUpload> The ArtifactoryKey can be taken from the TCD portal (go to General and take the value of ARTIFACTORY_KEY record): DestinationURL represents the exact location of the file that will be uploaded in the artifactory together with the name of the binary. For this operation, you need to take the exact path of the artifactory from the TCD portal from the Upload URL field that is displayed on the screen after the component is created: fileToUpload represents the binary that should be uploaded from your local machine and it must contain also the path where is present. Note Open source doesn’t support multiple file uploads at a time, therefore you need to upload the required binaries one by one. Example of the curl command based on the above : curl -H \"X-JFrog-Art-Api:AKCp5dKYyM9WMoiacim9yedAZfG6gLwwcYugPmzZhqHkdRe6ex6pZZnRMteQqedLE9Q3qds6V\" \" https://1dtk4nz95tssg-artifactory.temenos.cloud/artifactory/repo-1dtk4nz95tssg/dev_stream/demo_stage/t24-jars \" -T /drives/c/Users/file/t24-jars-63688104355895.zip For demo purposes, we used MobaXterm to upload the binary into the Artifactory as displayed below: Once the command is run, the binary is uploaded on the Artifactory: Pre-requisites and best practices • ensure that the component name also has information about its version • ensure that the component format that you upload is as expected by Temenos Continuous Deployment - every product has a template overview page (see here the expected components' format) • ensure that the components are uploaded to the appropriate folders (the URL and folder names can be found from the component definition pages of the Temenos Continuous Deployment portal) • if the component is uploaded in a .zip format, it is recommended to have a text file describing what is included in the package/ provide reference to the code commit tags to find what is included in the package • do not delete/ edit/ create components/ folders in the artifactory. The Temenos Continuous Deployment Portal’s Product and Component sections must be used to create anything in artifactory • our recommendation is to retain the last 25 components in every stage. Which Components to Add In order to know which are the minimum required components that you need to add, you must first check the Templates Catalog (see button on the left menu). From here, select the template that you want to use: make sure you select first the Template Type (FCM, T24, Tools, Wealth etc.). from the available Templates Catalog, select the one that you need in order to check the components. under Full Template Content, scroll until you see the components section. Note: usually there are at least two components sections: one related to T24 and another one refers to Model Bank Database (or other db). Depending on the template type, there could be more components, so please make sure you scroll down to check entirely the template in order to add all required components. it is required to add at least all the mandatory components. In addition to the mandatory components, you will need to add those components you need to test in the TestScript component - this not related to your selected template and the user needs to create it manually. WARNING: the TestScript component needs to be a .zip file within a .zip, otherwise the factory run will fail. See example below: For all added components, make sure you add the related files archive into the artifactory as explained above. How to Delete a Component Components fields are not editable, so you have only the options to create or to delete them. Note If your component is attached to a Product , you will not be able to delete it. You need first to delete the product, then return to the component and click Delete button. Products – Feature Description A product is a logical grouping of several components. This is just to make it easy for users to select a list of components to deploy instead of selecting each component in a sequence. A product has the following fields (all mandatory) : Name Description List of constituent components - at least one component is required Ultimately, a product is used in a factory and will be used eventually to deploy the required components. How to Set Up/ Edit/ Delete Products How to Set-up/ Create a Product From the left-side menu click on the Components icon Navigate to the Products tab If you have created more streams, select the Stream where you want to create the respective product (see top right) Click on New Product on top-right Add a name , description and select the mandatory components from drop-down button. This should represent the Principle Product (or one of the principle products) you will use when creating a factory Click Create Product See also below example. For components, the selection order is not important. In addition to the principle product which has all template mandatory components, you will need to create other products - Base Products - that will be used to be tested. To sort the products alphabetically, hover over the Name field from the top of the Products List. How to edit a product You can edit: The product description. The components field by adding or removing components. Just click the edit button, do the changes and then click update. How to delete a product Go to the Products tab and select the product you want to delete. Click the delete button. Note If the respective product is attached to a factory, you will not be able to delete. You need to delete the factory first. Artifactory view The artifactory view displays the uploaded components that are available for the all stages within a stream. Click on the icon to go to the Artifactory page. You need to login with your portal credentials to the Artifactory: Click on the icon to expand the Component details. Click on the component.zip to download the binary to your local machine: User Permissions Required To be able to perform the above operations the following permissions need to be enabled for your user: CREATE _ COMPONENT DELETE _ COMPONENT MANAGE _ COMPONENTS MANAGE - ORG - METADATA MANAGE _ STREAMS MANAGE _ STAGES CREATE _ STREAM MANAGE _ PRODUCTS CREATE _ PRODUCT UPDATE _ PRODUCT DELETE _ PRODUCT To have a better understanding of the user permissions, hover the cursor over the variables and a short description will pop up or click here to read more."

    "href": "home/techguides/customize-templates.html",
    "title": "Customize templates",
    "keywords": "Customize templates Introduction This document can be used by technical staff who need to customize already defined templates based on specific requirements. Templates customization will allow changes related to: the environment applications (i.e. the scripts to install and configure each application and the information displayed in the Portal for each application); the VM specifications in which each application is deployed. Note This guide presumes that a environment is already created and available under an Organisation for which the templates customization functionality is allowed. To start customizing your environment built using a Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform template, login to Temenos Continuous Deployment platform using your organisation user, go to your environment page and click on the Customize Template button attached to Repository application. After clicking the Customize Template button, a notification appears which informs that This will initiate template customization based on environment specifications and also change the automation scripts. Please review the Templates Customization guide. Tick the box and click Confirm to proceed. The message Customize Template initiated appears on the screen and the status of Repository application is changed to Customizing , as per bellow picture. The operation triggered by the Customize Template button copies in the environment repository all the template files used to create the environment. Note Click the Refresh button to see when the template customization is completed. Also below the environment description, following message is displayed \"Scripts are customized for this environment.\" and the button Save as a new template appears. Repository structure after template customization The difference in the environment repository after the template customization is the presence of the environments folder, as it can be observed bellow. If you want to keep the initial settings of your environment, it is advised to clone the environment and do the changes. Please check the following user guide to see how to clone an environment locally and get familiar with the below repository structure. The structure of the environments folder is represented by 4 folders (found under common folder) : extraPlays infra-templates playbooks roles Note Depending on the template type (Extend or Assemble), the extraPlays folder may be or may not be present. To check the template type, go to Templates Catalog button on the left side menu and check the template used for your environment. If it contains the Components section, it means this is an Assemble template type and the extraPlays folder will be present after customize template action. Important Depending on the template type (Extend or Assemble), the infra-templates and roles folders content may differ. For example: -- for Extend templates, to change the h2db role you need to change the main.yml file from common/roles/h2/tasks/ -- for Assemble templates to change the h2db role you need to change the deploy_main.yml file from common/roles/h2db/tasks/ The description of each folder is presented bellow: Folder Name Folder Description extraPlays This folder yml configuration files related to the template used in the creation of the environment. infra-templates This folder contains an infratemplate.yml file that describes the template of your environment (i.e. information related to the applications that are installed in your environment and VM specifications in which environment applications are deployed.). playbooks This folder contains a playbook.yml file that describes the set of roles that will be installed for each host(VM) defined under [services][servers] component in infratemplate.yml file. roles This folder contains all the roles defined for your template. A role represents any of your environment applications or it can be a module/plugin/framework that is required for your environment applications. A role is described by the following folders: defaults - contains default variables for the role. files - contains the files which are deployed using this role. handlers - contains handlers that are used by this role. meta - defines meta data for this role. tasks - contains the list of tasks that is executed for this role. templates - contains templates that can be deployed using this role. vars - contains the role variables. Note A role definition must include at least one of the above folders. Thus, any unused folders can be excluded. However, any in use folder must include a main.yml file that contains the relevant information, respectively a deploy_main.yml file in case of assemble templates.. Note Ansible automation tool is used by the Platform to automate the environment creation based on applications with specific requirements and installation steps. For more details about Ansible, please access this link . Start template customization There are several ways in which you can customize your environment template based on the type of your change. Note All the changes that must be implemented to a cloud environment template can be done only in environment repository . Thus, environment repository must be cloned in your local machine. For more information about how to clone an environment repository, please check this page . Changes that will require the rebuild of your environment : Note The rebuild operation will take around 20 minutes and it will recreate all environment resources (VMs) and run the deployment of all roles defined in environment template. To trigger the rebuild of your environment, login to the portal using your organisation user, go to your environment page and click on the Rebuild button attached to your environment main application. Changes related to applications that will be installed under your environment. The applications list is defined in [services][servers] component from infratemplate.yml file located in /environments/common/infra-templates folder of environment repository. An example of a template with 2 applications (t24 & h2) is presented bellow. -> If an application must be removed from the default application list of the template, then the corespondent item must be removed from [services][servers] component and the item related to the application must be removed from playbook.yml file from /environments/common/playbooks folder. -> If an application must be added to the default application list of the template, then a new item must be added in [services][servers] component. After this, a new role must be created for this application in /environments/common/roles folder of environment repository and playbook.yml file from /environments/common/playbooks must be updated with a new item for the new application. Changes related to applications information (name, description, etc.) displayed in the Portal. Each environment application has a related item in [services][servers] component from infratemplate.yml file. Please check the description of each key (e.g. app_name , app_description , etc.) in infratemplate.yml file in order to understand which information appear in the Portal. Changes related to VM specifications in which environment applications are deployed. The VM specifications on which each environment application is deployed are defined in [provider][azure][config] component from infratemplate.yml file. [server_size] key defines the VM specifications that will be applied for all applications defined in [services][servers] component. If different VM specifications must be applied to each environment application, then [server_size] key must be set in [services][servers] component for each application. The detailed VM specifications can be viewed here . Note After making the required changes, commit and push them to your environment repository and trigger the rebuild. To make sure there are no syntax erros in the updated infratemplate.yml file, you can use this online validator . Changes that will require the deployment of your environment : Note The deployment operation will take around 5 minutes or more depending on your changes. To trigger the deployment of your environment, login to the cloud portal using your organisation user, go to your environment page and click on the Deploy button attached to Repository application. Changes related to roles already present in template. (i.e. an environment is already created with this template) If an already present role must be updated (for example, the tasks list for a role must be updated), make the required changes for that role, commit and push the changes to the environment repository and trigger the deployment. Changes related to roles tha represent a module/plugin/framework and not an application. New roles that represent a module/plugin/framework and not an application can be added to an application of your environment. In order to accomplish this, a new role along its settings must be created in /environments/common/roles folder and the new role must be added to the specific application in playbook.yml file from /environments/common/playbooks folder. After this, push all these changes to environment repository and trigger the deployment. Changes that are not related to environment template. For the changes described here that are not related to environment template, you just have to commit and push the required changes to your environment repository and trigger the deployment. Note If the deployment operation is not successful for your changes, please rebuild the environment. The cloud portal catalogue of available templates can be checked here . <!-- <br /><span style=\"font-size:20px\">text</span> --> Save New Template After doing the above steps (template customization), go to the Actions tab on your environment, select the Save as a new template option. Fill in the Environment Name , Environment Description , read the note, tick the confirmation by which you understand the Save As Template action and agree to proceed further , then click Save . You will see a message on the screen Environment saved as a new template . Go to Templates Catalog and search for the new template, which will be available in the templates list."

Each Environment has an associated Repository for uploading different type of features based on the Environment Template type, these features being deployed automatically to your Environment. Before proceeding, please check the following requirements: Make sure you have a GUI Git Client installed in your local machine. This guide uses TortoiseGit Git Client that can be installed from here . Make sure you have an user created under your organisation that has a public ssh key attached. Please check this guide to understand how you can create an user or how you can generate and attach a ssh key to an user. Clone Environment Repository • Please login to your organisation, select your environment and locate the Endpoint of Repository Application (this is the last available endpoint on the environment page). Click the copy to clipboard icon from the right: • Create a folder in any location from your local machine. In the current example, a folder name GitLabRepo is used. • Go to your local repository folder(GitLabRepo folder in our example), right click inside the folder and choose Git Clone . • The bellow screen is opened where you have to paste the Endpoint of Repository Application of your Environment in URL textbox, set the Directory textbox to your local repository folder(GitLabRepo folder in our example) and load your private key. • Content is downloaded from the Repository of your Environment to your local machine. Repository Structure The repository structure on your local machine should look like this: Warning Do not delete, change or move the environment folder . This contains the manifest file. Folder Functionality addons This folder is designed for AppDynamics. Upload files as JAR. client_files\\h2db Local H2 database that will be uploaded to the Cloud Environment. Database username must be t24 and password t24 (case sensitive). Database name is mandatory to be “TAFJDB.h2.db” (case sensitive) and must be archived as a ZIP with name TAFJDB.zip (case sensitive). If the above conditions are not satisfied, the database will not be uploaded to the Cloud Environment. This procedure will replace the existing database in the cloud with this one. The old database will be lost, including any records loaded manually. client_files\\helptext Custom Help Text files can be uploaded in this folder. The file structure must be the same as HELP.TEXT T24 core. Thus, under client_files\\helptext folder, the HelpText folder with subfolders for each component (AA, EB, PP, etc.) is expected. packages If you intend to upload one or more Design Studio packages, add it here as a .jar file. Note that the Temenos Continuous Deployment platform does not support the old .d format for Design Studio packages and only support the current ESON or version/enquiry records. packages\\l3 One or more Design Studio packages can be bundled in a .zip file format and uploaded in this folder. Note that the Temenos Continuous Deployment platform does not support the old .d format for Design Studio packages and only support the current ESON or version/enquiry records. plugins WAR files can be uploaded in this folder. The files will be deployed inside Jboss EAP. In addition to this, endpoints related to plugins can be automatically added to an application. For more details, check this guide. updates The updates files downloaded from the portal in .zip of .zip format. The files will be copied to the update folder and the T24 Update procedure is triggered. wsdl WSDL files and folders that are required by plug-ins (war file) need to be uploaded here. client_files\\sqldb The SQL database will be uploaded to the client_files\\sqldb folder. The file extensions of the database must be .bak, .zip or both (i.e. in case of more .bak files need to be uploaded, you can add them under a .zip which would also reduce the size during Git deploy). Note: the .zip or .bak file can have any name. Nonetheless, the database name within the SQL database backup file must be UTPSQLDB. If the database name is other than UTPSQLDB, the database deployment will not work. The database credentials, schema security group access, logical/physical file names, etc, should be followed as in UTP SQL model bank database. By default, the Recovery model parameter is ‘FULL’, incase of a larger database/more transactions involved, then it is preferred to set the parameter as ‘SIMPLE’. This parameter will be retained after DB import/cloned to a new environment. In case you need to convert the database from H2 to SQL DB, please raise a PACS ticket. client_files\\l3-pre-dsf-packages To make changes to T24 records we use l3-pre-dsf and l3-post-dsf packages. The priority and order of deployment can be specified in pre and post packages. Go to the How to deploy the DSF packages instructions to learn more. client_files\\l3-post-dsf-packages Same functionality as above. Additional folders The bellow folders are not present as default in environment repository. In any of the bellow functionalities is required, the folder related to that functionality must be first created in environment repository and only after this the functionality of the folder can be used. Folder Functionality client_files\\localjars This folder is designed for local JARs (not released by T24 Core) installation. Any JAR file used by T24 or other parties can be uploaded in this folder. During deployment, all JARs present in this folder will be deployed in the environment. If a JAR file is corrupted or some dependencies are missing, the environment will not start. A module.xml file is regenerated based on all the JAR files. client_files\\localjars\\ext This folder is designed for local JARs installation inside TAFJ/ext folder from the environment. Commit & Push features to Repository • Go to repository folder from your local machine(GitLabRepo folder in our example) and copy your file/files (related to your required features that must be deployed to your Environment) to the specific folder/folders based on your requirement. In this guide, an update is pushed to the Environment Repository. Important: T24 Updates must be packaged as .zip of .zip file while it is deployed through the Git repository (the parent .zip file name can be anything). Example: T24-updates.zip |__T24-Updates-2020-X-Y.zip |__ *.Jar • To commit the files/files to Environment Repository, right click inside repository folder from your local machine and choose Git Commit -> \"master\"... option. • The following screen will appear in which your repository changes can be observed and commited. In order to commit, you have to input a commit message and check the checkbox next to each new file if it is the case. • The following screen will appear in which you have to push your changes to Environment Repository. In order to push, click the Push button. • In the next screen, you have to click Ok button. • Finally, the status screen for your push action is displayed. Trigger Deployment • After all required features are commited and pushed to Environment Repository, you have to deploy these features in your Environment. To do this, login to your organisation, select your environment, locate Repository Application and click the Deploy button. • The Environment and its manageable Applications status will be changed to Deploying during the deployment process and the Deploy button becomes disabled until the deployment is finished. The logs generated by the deployment process can be also observed in the Events tab of your Environment where a new event for RepositoryDeploy will be created. Note The deployment process is triggered manually by the user after commiting and pushing all the required features in Environment Repository or whenever is appropiate based on the fact that the user can commit and push features to Environment Repository multiple times and choose when to trigger the deployment. How Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform installs DS packages Temenos Continuous Deployment provides users the ability to deploy one or more Design Studio packages into the environment. This pages explains what happens in the background when packages are deployed to the environment. one or more DS packages which with the .jar extension can be added directly into the Git folder packages as shown below. one or more DS packages can be bundled into a .zip file and put under the Git folder packages/l3 folder the following files are cleared from the environment: <T24_HOME>/packages <T24_HOME/REL.*.ESON <T24_HOME>/REL.*.XML Any existing /log/packageDataInstaller.txt will be renamed to /log/packageDataInstaller- .txt all the packages files with the .zip format are unziped to the package folder a backup of the &SAVEDLISTS& f older is created the T24PackageInstaller command is run for all the files under the package folder an error message is displayed if the output of the above command is not successful all the files released to DSPackageInstaller folder are copied to l3lib folder a module.xml is regenerated based on all the JAR files run the packageDataInstaller command. We retry this command until the records from the packages are all deployed or some records cannot be deployed further besides iteration. the output of the command above command is saved into a file in TAFJ/log named packageDataInstaller.txt . An overall result of retries will be written at the end of packageDataInstaller.txt, which is X0 or X1. an error message is displayed in the events log if the output of the packageDataInstaller command gives error X1 a information message appears in the events log if the output of the packageDataInstaller command is successful X0 once the above steps are completed, an automated task is run to authorize all the exception records the appserver is restarted and the environment is accesible. How Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform installs updates When a T24 update is deployed into a Temenos Continuous Deployment environment, either via the Deploy button or during a factory run , the following steps take place in sequence in the background. Note : $T24_HOME corresponds to UD folder. The environment variables and paths correspond to Linux based environment. Nonetheless, the same set of steps are executed for Windows templates. $T24_HOME corresponds to the path to UD folder. The $T24_HOME/&SAVEDLISTS& contains the UpdateLog and the REL files corresponding to the updates. Please check the files under $T24_HOME/&SAVEDLISTS& along with TAFJ/Log folder in SFTP in case of update failures. $T24_HOME/updater/bin is given proper rights (if it does not exist already) a folder called T24Updates is created under $T24_HOME/../JARS folder a backup of the $T24_HOME/&SAVEDLISTS& folder is taken and the folder is created again as type UD the T24Version and the updater command is run from updater/bin in the tafj.properties file, the precompile path is updated with the T24Updates folder path. The path will be $T24_HOME/../JARS/T24Updates:$T24_HOME/../JARS/t24lib the automated script stops all the TSA.SERVICE that are in AUTO and START mode. Please check the logs $T24_HOME/SER.LIST for more details on the services that are stopped during this step the updates released are copied from the updates folder to T24Updates folder. In case of service updates, the automated script copies the libraries under the main update folder and not the ones from extensions T24.UPDATE.SERVICE is run in the environment the automated script authorises the exceptions the automated script reverts the TSA.SERVICES to their previous state. Please refer to $T24_HOME/SER.LIST for the list of services that will be restored during this process. How to deploy the DSF packages To deploy DSF packages, the following components must be present in Extend/ Assemble environments: DSF Packager artefacts available in the T24 Environment. It is assumed that the UXP license file includes the license for the domain *.temenos.cloud. Reach out to Temenos license team to confirm the same. dsf-iris.war dsf-uxp.war IRF Catalog service in T24 environment: irf-t24catalog-services.war IRIS Catalog service in T24 environment: t24-eb-catalog-service-ejb.jar DSF Package Structure The l3-pre-dsf-packages and/or l3-post-dsf-packages containing DSF packages have the format of zip of zip . See below a sample package: DSF Deployment Overview See below what happens in the environment when a DSF packacke is deployed: The zip of zip file is downloaded into a temporary file within the TCD environment A curl command is executed to deploy the package file in the zip format. See the example below: curl -X POST -L -F \"package=@MyTestPack-1.0.0.zip;type=application/zip\" http://<dnsname>/dsf-iris/api/v1.0.0/meta/dsfpackages/deploy) The output of the curl command is displayed in the events log See below a sample output of a successful deployment (this is available in your Events tab on your environment page): See below a sample output of a failed deployment (this is available in your Events tab on your environment page): DSF Deployment Notes For the factory run, the components mentioned in 1, 2 and 3 from the How to deploy the DSF packages should be defined in the factory. In an Extend environment, there will be two new folders named pre-dsf-packages and post-dsf-packages : In case you only have one set of DSF package to be installed into a Temenos Continuous Deployment Extend environment, please include the package in** pre-dsf-packages** folder in the GIT. We currently support a single file inside the pre-dsf / post-dsf folders. Bundle all your DSF Packages into a .zip file before uploading them User Permissions Required To be able to perform the above operations the below permissions need to be enabled for your user: UPDATE_USER (it is required to add the SSH Key if this hasn't been done after creating the user) CREATE_ENVIRONMENT UPDATE_ENVIRONMENT DELETE_ENVIRONMENT REDEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT START_ENVIRONMENT STOP_ENVIRONMENT MANAGE_ENVIRONMENTS To have a better understanding of the user permissions, hover the cursor over the variables and a short description will pop up or click here to read more."

    "keywords": "Environment Basic Operations After creating an environment, there are several actions (operations) that can be done via the available buttons: Filter the Environment by typing in the keywords Filter the environments' list by ticking the Extend , Manual factory or Automated Factory . Start All User Environments , Stop All User Environments , Refresh , Create New Environment Environment buttons The user can also clone , edit , delete , start , stop , rebuild , export the database and deploy the repository and use the endpoints related to T24, the database or to the repository: Start All User Environments button - use this button to only start all user environments Stop All User Environments button - stops all running VMs that are part of the Environment Refresh the page - use this button to refresh any action in progress (related to an environment but also to a factory) Create a New Environment - displays the fields required to create an environment. here you can give a name and a description to your environment and choose a template the Actions button from the right-side of the screen is expandable and allows the user to: Start an environment - after creating an environment, the Start button is automatically disabled as the environment is running. It will be enabled if an environment is stopped and it will start all the instances specified in the Environment configuration. When the environment is stopped, start button is supposed to start the VMs where the database and the application server of a T24 environment are installed and also to start the application server (jboss, wildfly, WebSphere, etc.) so that T24 to be up and running. However, please note that start button is not triggering also the deployment of whatever is present into the associated Git repository (such as something that was committed when the environment was stopped or a T24 update package ( L1 development) that was not yet successfully deployed to the T24 area). Stop an environment - stop all running VMs that are part of the environment. Rebuild an environment - recreate the resources into the cloud and re-installs T24 and H2 db. This is used for example when modifying the application templates (i.e. changing the T24 displayed name or adding a new application). Save as new template - the functionality is enabled by default to an environment. the functionality copies all the components from the environment GIT Repository to Artifactory and saves them as a new template. To save the new template, you need to have the mandatory components uploaded and deployed successfully. This is to ensure that there will be no issues in any environment created from the new template. If all the mandatory components are deployed successfully then you can save the new template otherwise the Save as new template fails. To proceed, click on the Save as new template and read the information in the pop-up. Fill in the blanks, tick the box and then click on Save Template . Edit the environment - change the name and the description of an environment. You can ignore the Auto Start / Stop Scheduler as configured in the Schedule Environments from the General Tab: Clone environment - create an identical environment by copying the Environment and configuration repository Upgrade - the feature is only available for the Model Bank TSS/ OSS Stack Template , therefore Extend environments. By clicking on Upgrade you can boost the environment to the target template version. Upon clicking on the button a pop-up appears which prompts to select another template from the list of available template: Click on Upgrade to proceed. The environment status changes to Upgrading : In the Events tab you can see the log which refers to the upgrade from the Base template to Target template Upgrade Validations: The Upgrade button is enabled at the organisation level. Once the Upgrade is initiated all the environment action buttons are disabled except Edit Environment and Delete Environment buttons. Only users with the permission UPGRADE_TEMPLATE will have the Upgrade button enabled on their environment. The Upgrade button is not available on a stopped environment. Make sure you have a Database Backup before the upgrade. L3 or other plugins present in the current template are not auto deployed, and you have to upload them back to GIT and deploy it post upgrade. The upgrade pipeline will not deploy anything on the GIT folder to the upgraded environment automatically, therefore you have to manually trigger this post upgrade. The new app server won’t have any additional queues. The upgrade flow is from the client template to ModelBank template and not vice-versa. An environment created with a custom template can be upgraded to a ModelBank template and not vice versa. When an environment is upgraded, the Clone and Rebuild options are not available. The Upgrade functionality is not available for environments resulted from factory runs (automated and manual factories). Upgrade is supported from Python-based templates to Python-based templates only. An environment can only be upgraded with a MB template that is assigned to your organisation. You won't be able to upgrade a MB-T24-Wildfly-H2-202002 to a MB-T24-Wildfly-H2-202004 if the latter version is not assigned to your organisation. After the upgrade is completed you can: Rebuild the upgraded environment from the Actions button - a pop-up informs that Any changes made to the environment will be lost and the environment will be reset to its original state. . To proceed, tick the checkbok and click Confirm Clone the upgraded environment from the Actions button - a pop-up appears where you need to insert the Environment Name , Environment Description and Labels . The pop-up informs that if L3 packages are manually altered, then they will not be copied and the clone may not work if the T24 environment is upgraded: Customize Template from the Repository Section - a pop-up informs where you can find the template customization user guide and that the Customize My Template will not work if T24 environment is upgraded . To proceed, tick the checkbox and click Confirm : Note: the Customize Template functionality is not enabled for factory run environments (automated and manual factories). T24 Release section - available actions Endpoints : Depending on the template used to provision your environment, you will be able to access the below endpoints: T24 Browser Web TAFJ Web Application Access Environment Files (login with your portal credentials) UXP Browser IRIS APIs IRIS Runtime IRIS Workbench Temenos Workbench Temenos Connect User Administration (TCUA) Internet Banking - Retail Design Studio Kit - you can start downloading Design Studio tool (DS version is compatible with your environment). To access this endpoints you check the Template Name (you will find it under the environment name in the Environment page) Go to the Templates Catalogue , select the Template Type from the top-right, then look for the template you used for to provision the environment. On that Template page, under the Release Notes tab you can see the template’s Topology which displays all the credentials you need. Buttons Exporting an environment allows to export and import an environment or a database through SFTP server Clicking the 'Export Environment' button will generate a zip file on the tcdSFTP.temenos.cloud portal containing: all jar files deployed in T24 sandbox and the correspondent module.xml file; the content of the default folder of T24; all war files deployed in the T24 sandbox and the Jboss server log. Database section - available actions Buttons Export the database - by clicking the \"Export database\" button a zip file will be generated in the tcdSFTP.temenos.cloud portal which will contain the current database of the sandbox. Note: This database can be used as a backup that can be deployed later on into the sandbox as a duplicate for testing/development or for local development before deploying to the cloud. Endpoints tcdSFTP.temenos.cloud - allows you to copy the SFTP link. Repository section - available actions Buttons Customize template - the operation triggered by the button will copy in the environment repository all the template files used to create the environment Deploy button - used when deploying newly added plugins, endpoints, updates, web services, packages etc. Endpoints This section displays the GitLab repository correspondent to your T24 sandbox that you can copy it in order to clone the repository. example: git@tcdGitlab.temenos.cloud:1dyomzt4lxuyo/corebanking.git Note IMPORTANT! As a good practice and in terms of reducing your costs, it is recommended that you don't keep an environment unused . Even if it's not used, it will still generate costs. The environment will be deleted by the Extend team (with a prior mail notification) when it is unused for more than 3 days (for internal clients), respectively for more than 7 days (for external clients). Also to reduce costs, the environment can be put on Stop and started only when required. The environments that are stopped will not be deleted. Schedule Environments Users have the option to schedule environments at their convenience. To proceed: go to the left-side menu click on General select the 'Schedule Environments' tab The user can either start or stop all environments on certain dates, days or at a certain hour (UTC time zone). User Permissions Required To be able to perform basic environment operations the below permissions need to be enabled for your user: MANAGE _ ENVIRONMENTS CREATE _ ENVIRONMENT UPDATE _ ENVIRONMENT DELETE _ ENVIRONMENT BOOST _ ENVIRONMENT REDEPLOY _ ENVIRONMENT START _ ENVIRONMENT STOP _ ENVIRONMENT ALLOW - EXPORT - ENVIRONMENT START - ALL - ENVIRONMENT STOP - ALL - ENVIRONMENT SCHEDULE _ ENVIRONMENT ALLOW - EXPORT - ENVIRONMENT MANAGE _ ENVIRONMENTS To have a better understanding of the user permissions, hover the cursor over the variables and a short description will pop up or click here to read more."

    "title": "What happens when COB is triggered during a Factory Run",
    "keywords": "What happens when COB is triggered during a Factory Run This user guide explains what happens when COB is triggered during a factory run. COB can be run in company wise (e.g.: COB-GB0010001), group wise (e.g.: COB-1), or system wide (COB) in a Temenos Continuous Deployment environment as a part of test workflow (see how to manage workflows here ). To run COB for multiple groups or companies at the same time when setting up the factory , provide the TSA.SERVICE record ID separated by dots (e.g. COB-1.COB-2) in the TSA.SERVICE ID in the portal. Note: the maximum sessions configured in the TAFJEE and standalone.xml is 20 by default. Hence if you run COB with 20 agents, the environment will become unresponsive. All the information related to each of the automated steps are written into a log in the path $T24_HOME/Regression/RegressionLog . Please refer this file along with the $TAFJ_HOME/log_T24/como folder to monitor the progress of the COB. In case of a crash/ error, the test factory will give a 12 hour window for the end user to correct (if possible) and re-trigger the COB manually from the TAFJ servlet. If left unattended the COB hangs the build will be terminated after 12 hours. Below you will see what happens behind the scenes when a COB is triggered using Temenos Continuous Deployment: There are some custom T24 routines written to prepare, excute and monitor the COB. As a first step, these routines are compiled in the environment. The TSM and any other running services are stopped in the environment TSA.STATUS for COB and TSM and BATCH.STATUS for TSM is cleared. This is done by the routine AR.StopService. Once the services are stopped, the appserver and the database is stopped and a backup of the database is taken . This will be available in the machine in the path and file name with date time as shown in the example $T24_HOME../TAFJDB-1501173540.zip. The T24_HOME corresponds to the UD path, the number in the backup fil ename corresponds to the Ansible epoch time, when the backup was taken. Once the environment is up after the COB, this file can be accessed from the SFTP location for that environment. The DB and appserver are restarted , and the routine AR.FixEODerrors is ran in the environment to fix the EB.EOD.ERRORS (if any). A routine AR.DateExtract is run to extract Today’s date and company details for each of the TSA Service ID’s provided in the TSA.SERVICE parameter in the test configuration. This will be extracted and stored in a following file $T24_HOME/DatesOutput/TODAYsDATE.txt. The output of this routine is used by the Temenos Continuous Deployment scripts to trigger and monitor the COB. The TSA.SERVICES provided in the TSA.SERVICE parameter in the test configuration is started. This is done by a routine AR.StartService Once COB is started, the monitoring job monitors the COB to see if it gets completed. The routine AR.CobcheckProcess. The following statuses are reported in the Events log in case of problem. CRASHED, STOPPED or COMPLETED. If more than one TSA.SERVICE is triggered, the COB step will be completed only if all the services are completed successfully. Click HERE to download the RegressionLog and TODAYsDATE.txt samples."

    "title": "Introduction",
    "keywords": "Introduction This user guide shows different ways of accessing details related to your development environment when deploying the following: Design Studio Packages Plugins Updates WAR files 1. Export Environment Details The Export Environment Details functionality gives you access to different information related to your sandbox like: -> the T24 UD (default) folder from your T24 sandbox -> the jars deployed in your T24 sandbox -> the war files deployed(with success or not) in your T24 sandbox -> the jboss server.log from your T24 sandbox. The environment details are exported in a SFTP server to which you have to connect in order to download the related files in your local machine. For this purpose, make sure you download and install WinSCP SFTP client. The Export Environment Details functionality can be triggered from PaaS Portal following the bellow steps: Log-in to your organisation in PaaS Portal, go to your enviroment page and click on the Export Environment button for the T24 application. After click, the Export Environment button will become disabled(as per bellow picture), meaning that the export was triggered. Note The Export Environment action is finished when the Export Environment button becomes enabled. In order to download the exported files of your environment from the SFTP server to your local machine: In PaaS Portal for your organisation, go to your environment page and Right click and copy the sftp.temenos.cloud Endpoint or click the copy to clipboard icon from the right: Open WinSCP SFTP client and create a new site that will allow you to connect to the SFTP server. Make sure you put tcdSFTP.temenos.cloud Endpoint as Host name, your PaaS user as User name and instead of password, the SSH key related to your PaaS user must be used. In order to attach the SSH key, press Advanced button, go to Authentification menu and select the private key related to your PaaS user. After attaching your SSH key, save your site with any name for future use. Click Login to connect to the SFTP server. If connection is successful, you will have 2 sections in WinSCP: -> the left section(highlighted in black) represents the location from your local machine where the environment details will be downloaded. -> the right section(highlighted in yellow) represents the location of the exported environment details in the SFTP server; the environment details are saved in the SFTP server in /organisationID/environmentID folder structure. Go inside your environmentID folder and you will see a zip file that contains the Environment Details. In order to download the zip, select it and press F5. After downloading the zip file to your local machine, unzip it. Based on the template used, you will be able to see the below scenarios: a) For Extend-Templates - once you downloaded the file and unzipped it on your local machine, the below folders will appear b) For Wildfly, Stack01 and Stack02 Templates - once you downloaded the file and unzipped it on your local machine, the below folders will appear: Based on the above folder structure, you can check the following: -> If you deployed any update in your sandbox, check if jar/jars related to the update are changed in the jar list from modules/com/temenos/t24/main folder. -> If you deployed any package in your sandbox, check if the jar related to the package is present in modules/com/temenos/t24/main/localjars folder. -> If you deployed any war file in your sandbox, check if the war was deployed with success(a file named war_name.deployed should be present in standalone\\deployments folder). The war deployment will be failed if a file named war_name.failed is present in standalone\\deployments folder and this file must be checked for details. > [!Note] > For Stack02 Template in the 'appserver' folder you will find 'installed apps' folder instead of 'deployments'. 2. TAFJEE Monitoring Tool TAFJEE Monitoring Tool can be used in the following situations: -> To get the TAFJ installation details from your Environment (using tDiag Servlet) -> To get the compilation details for a T24 routine from your Environment (using tShow Servlet) -> To access various logs from your Environment like Database log or Runtime log (using Logger Servlet) -> To access como content from your Environment (using Como Servlet) -> To execute DBTools commands (using DBTools Servlet). To access the TAFJE Monitoring Tool for your Environment, log-in to your organisation in PaaS Portal, go to your enviroment page and click on the MONITOR APPLICATION Endpoint for the T24 application. The bellow page is opened from which various servlets can be accessed. TAFJ Environment Information To view various information about the TAFJ Environment from your Environment, access the TAFJ Monitoring Tool of your Environment from PaaS Portal and select tDiag option from the Diagnostic section. The next page is opened in which information like TAFJ installation details, Environment details, TAFJ Runtime properties, T24 Monitoring properties and TAFJ Session Monitor properties can be found. T24 Routine Information To view the compilation details for a T24 Routine from your Environment, access the TAFJ Monitoring Tool of your Environment from PaaS Portal and select tShow option from the Diagnostic section. The next page is opened in which you must enter the name of the T24 Routine. Click Submit to get the compilation details. The details like compilation date or the .jar file that contains the class of the T24 Routine are displayed. Logs Information To view different log files from your Environment (Database log/Runtime log), go to the TAFJ Monitoring Tool of your Environment from PaaS Portal and select Log files option from the Troubleshooting section. The next page is opened in which you can select any log from the list and change dynamically the log level (6 log levels are available: FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE). For example, to view the Database log for a specific level, go to the Database log part of the page, choose the appropriate level and click View . The Database log information for the selected level is displayed. Note To change the log level for a specific logger, select from the Level Filter combo box the appropriate level and the page will be refreshed automatically based on the selected level. Como Information The TAFJ Monitoring Tool offers the possibility of viewing the log files generated when running different tSAs(Temenos Service Agents) or when installing T24 packages or T24 updates in your Environment. This is achieved with the aid of the Como servlet which provides direct access to the &COMO& folder content from your Environment. To view the Como content, go to the TAFJ Monitoring Tool of your Environment from the Development platform portal and select Como files option from the Troubleshooting section. The next page is opened in which you can select for which Como log do you want to View the details. In the bellow example, the Como log generated for installing a T24 package is displayed.

    "keywords": "Introduction This document can be used by technical staff who need to create Users on the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform and associate to each user a ssh key. How to create Users The Administrator can navigate to the Users section on the portal, create more users and invite them to access and use the portal using the URL link. In this way the administrator is in control of who receives the URL link and which users can access the Organisation. The users can access their organisation only, view their user profiles and perform various operations according to the set of user permissions set by the Organisation Administrator. Note that only the users with the 'Admin' permission can create more users. To manage/ see the users please refer to the below: • Login to your organisation portal using the link and the credentials provided. Go to the menu on the left and then click Users tab, as below: Click on the Users tab To order the users' list hover over the Name tab - the users will be listed in an alphabetical order Click on the Status tab to see the status of each user (i.e. the user status can be creating, editing, failed, deleting ) Create a new user by clicking the New user button on the top-right corner. Fill in the username, email, password and the user role (the SSH Key can be added later on if needed): Click Create This will create a new user in your organisation. This new user will be automatically assigned to all GitLab Repositories from within all environments. If you have already a user created, you can click on the user and update the SSH key box with the one created above. Important! : It is the Organisation Admin's responsibility to inform the new user about its credentials and set of permissions granted on the portal. On their first login, all new users will be forced to reset the password that was initially created by the Organisation Admin. User Roles Management By default, when your organisation is created, Temenos will provide you the link and access instructions to your designated organisation administrator (the first and only user with full rights on the platform). Click on the Roles tab to see the available list of roles within your organisation Hover over the Name tab to display the alphabetical order of the available roles Select the number of items you'd like to have listed on the page (this is applicable for the users' tab as well) The administrator can create more users and navigate to the Roles section on the portal to assign various permissions to each user. To create a role, click on New Role on top-right and fill in the blanks: The admin can select which permissions to set to each user. Once the role is created, the admin can assign it to a specific user: go to the 'Users' tab and select the user choose from the drop-down list the user click 'Edit' on the user choose from the drop-down list the role that needs to be assigned To understand what which of the permission does, hover the cursor over the variables and a short description will pop up or click here to get an overview of the permissions. For security purposes, if you are inactive for more than 5 minutes on the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform a dialog box pop up prompts on the screen in the last minute of your inactive session which asks to choose whether you want to extend the session or logout. By clicking Extend your session will still be active If you opt to Logout or don’t take any action on the pop-up your session will expire. Note that the environment creation, factory runs or other organization operations will still be running. How to use PuTTY SSH client for SSH key generation. Should the users requires access to the source code repository they need to provide their public SSH Keys on the user profile section to gain access. https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/ ) You can use any other SSH key generator client. Note If you already have installed a SSH key generator client, you can skip this step. • Download the installer from http://www.putty.org/ • Run the installer and click Next on each screen, without changing anything in configurations. Click Finish once completed. How to create the SSH keys (pair public and private keys) • Open PuTTYgen and click Generate button: • This creates a new SSH key by moving the mouse in the blank area (highlighted in red), as per bellow picture. • After PuTTYgen has finished the key generation, you can save your public key/private key in any location from your local machine. Note In order to have a valid SSH key that can be recognized by Infrastructure, do not use the Save public key button from PuTTygen and just select the whole public key from the PuTTYgen screen and save it in your local machine. • From the PuTTYgen screen you must also save the private key. Press the Save private key button, choose 'Yes' on the next prompt (save the key without a passphrase to protect it) and indicate a name and location for the private key. • The public/private key location on your local machine should look like this: How to add users on the portal with the SSH keys Note All fields are mandatory! See further below how to generate the SSH key • Public SSH key needs to be pasted in SSH Key text box. Open Windows Explorer and locate your public key generated using PuTTY Key Generator. • Right click and open it with notepad. Select all and copy to clipboard. • Paste the copied text into the SSH Key text box and click Create user button. Your user is now available in the user list. You have the option to edit or to delete it. Note Once created, you cannot change the name and the email address, nor the user's password. You can only update (or add) the SSH key through edit button. Your username will be created in Gitlab server and public SSH key provided will be added to your account being accessible from all the environments created in your organisation. For further details or issues related to Gitlab SSH keys usage, or other operating systems (MAC, Linux), please consult this link: [https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/]( To see the details of a user please make sure to first select the user from the left-side users list: User Permissions Required To be able to create a user the below permission needs to be enabled for your user: CREATE _ USER To have a better understanding of the user permissions, hover the cursor over the variables and a short description will pop up or click here to read more."

    "keywords": "What is Temenos Continuous Deployment? Temenos Continuous Deployment (TCD) is an offering from Temenos SaaS that provides client individuals and teams with the ability to manage, configure and assemble client licensed Temenos Software. Temenos Continuous Deployment enables you to create Environments, i.e. Temenos Suites on-demand, for non-production use in the cloud. The speed, reliability, and agility of these environments will instantly add value to your implementation and scale your project delivery capacity. Temenos Continuous Deployment What is the “Assemble” service module of the Temenos Continuous Deployment? “Assemble” module provides a DevOps solution to perform continuous integration and delivery of Temenos Products, its customisation and thereby enabling faster time to market. The Assemble service module can accelerate the pace of change and increase confidence in the software deliveries by managing the Assemble of Components (updates, main release, and Level 3 developments), the provisioning into testing Environments, the execution of tests scripts, and providing detailed dashboards of the results. This Assemble service module further allows the Client to configure Products and Releases, which match their own specific needs. The main objective being to streamline ongoing change and accelerate implementation / upgrade projects. What is the “Extend” service module of the Temenos Continuous Deployment? The Extend module of the Temenos Continuous Deployment is used by the ‘change the bank’ teams for self-service management of Environments and provides access to the tools for enhancing Temenos solutions. The portal enables authorised users to provision Environments from a list of Templates. These Environments are for non-production use during development, test, integration, implementation phases. Features Self-service environment provisioning An authenticated user, e.g. a developer or tester, has the ability to request an environment from the catalogue of templates; this template will be materialised into compute, storage, and networks on the Temenos SaaS. The administrator, e.g. the project manager, is in control of number of the users and maximum number of running environments, thus having total control of the platform and its usage. Secure configuration and environment management A developer, is able to configure a personal SSH Key on their user profile and use this key to securely push changes over SSH. Deployment of change into the environment is fully automated for configuration, updates, plugins, add-ons and data. These changes can be stored in a software configuration management repository and deployed to the environment via a Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment process. Controlling the environment A user is able to start, stop, delete, and export data from an environment. Furthermore, a user is able to push a database into the configuration repository and rebuild the environment, thereby refreshing the database back to that point in time and re-apply transactions and configuration as required. As an example, a developer or a tester can load a database and collaborate to validate changes and test cases in a shared environment. Should these users need to delete or migrate an environment, they can export the data, create a fresh environment with the latest release, upload the data and continue working all managed through the portal. Monitoring the environment A user can export the application log data, monitor the status of the environments (started, starting, stopped, stopping, rebuilding), and see the results of any application deployments. Controlling the application The Temenos core banking template exposes endpoints for the user interface and TAFJEE management screens that allows a user to control COB job services."

    "title": "Architecture Overview",
    "keywords": "Architecture Overview Overview This section provides an overview of what the Temenos Continuous Deployment solution is, and how it fits in with the wider Temenos and bank enterprise. Enterprise View The Temenos Continuous Deployment solution is composed of the Extend and Assemble modules to enable the provision of development and Integration test environments. The current state allows for these two modules only. Roadmap features envisage a Deliver module to cover pre-production and production environments. The The Extend module is a multi-tenanted provisioning and deployment module that provides Users and/or other systems with self-service management of Environments and provides access to the tools for enhancing Client Licensed Temenos Software. The Extend module enables authorised Users to provision Environments from a list of Templates for non-production use during development, test, integration, implementation and ongoing changes to the Products. The Extend module is a cloud-hosted platform service and manages Environments in either the Temenos cloud or a Client’s Target Cloud account. Each Environment is a standalone instance of one or more Products or approved third-party applications / products running on the middleware defined in the Template. Each Factory is formed of an Environment and one or more Test Clients. The Test Clients have their own Templates, which define their infrastructure, software Components and configuration. The The Assemble module performs the test pipeline automation, continuous integration (“CI”) and continuous delivery (“CD”) of Client’s changes to Client’s Licensed Temenos Software. The Assemble Module utilises the same technologies as the Extend module, and does: deploy Test Clients; execute the Clients’ tests; orchestrate the deployment of Environments with Factories and the promotion of Packages through a workflow; manage storage of test results and application logs; manage the lifecycle of test Environments; provide a dashboard of test results with links to the underlying manifests, templates and, where appropriate, running Environments. The Temenos Continuous Deployment test result dashboard is a multi-tenanted web application hosted and operated by Temenos. The dashboard shows historic test results for a Factory within a configured Release and trends through a web UI pulling data from the Assemble Modules local database and test results and application logs in Target Cloud storage. The Temenos Continuous Deployment Artifact Repository is a third-party artifact repository “Artifactory by Jfrog” . The repository holds all the built software Components that are referenced by the Templates at the relevant test and deploy Stages. The Client will push all of its Product packages to the Artifact Repository The Temenos Continuous Deployment platform has two distinct deployment domains as below: the “Platform Cloud” where the provisioning software runs; the “Target Cloud” where the T24 environments are provisioned. Where does Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform fit into the enterprise IT landscape? The Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform promotes the concept of simplified and standardised change promotion through the IT landscape. Typical organisations have a number of non-production (i.e. development/test) environments, where changes are implemented and checked prior to deployment to production systems. The Devops movement seeks to improve this QA process through means of automation, which both allows an increase in speed in change promotion, and a reduction in the risk of manual errors when promoting changes. The Development Platform includes a simple and repeatable method of collating changes (both configuration and customisation) which subsequently is simple to promote from environment to environment. In addition, the core function of the Deployment Platform is to simplify the environment provisioning process, which means if extra stages in the change flow are required (e.g. for additional testing phases), it becomes far simpler to spin up temporary environments for these purposes. It should be noted that the Development platfrom only supplies non-production environments (also known as 'sandboxes'), which means organisations will still require at least one non-production environment on representative hardware in order to sanity check changes prior to production release (see example below). Delegating platform and infrastructure responsibilities to a third party allows organisations to concentrate on what is important to them - applications and data. The Deployment platform may be used for simple environment provisioning, or may be augmented by additional tools (such as Continuous Integration tooling) to provide a streamlined and automated development experience. The change promotion mechansim within the Temenos Continuous Deployment is simple to plug into standard CI tooling to push code/config/data from environment to environment. An example development flow is shown below: What are the components of Temenos Continuous Deployment? Development & Testing environments are managed by the Development Portal, and are comprised of distinct components as described below: Component Description Portal The Portal is the front-end component of the Deployment Platform which allows users to perform management functions across development environments. These functions include user management and environment provisioning/scaling. Configuration Repository The Configuration Repository is the 'change hub' for the Deployment Platform. It supports configuration and customisation (per environment), including T24 updates, custom config/code packages, database imports and third party plug-ins/add-ons. T24 Instance The T24 instance comprises the application and database for T24. The application tier may be scaled horizontally as required (via the management facility in the Portal). Exports (File Storage) The T24 database may be exported via the management facility in the Portal, as may the 'environment' (file system level). These exports are stored per environment and may be downloaded by users via SFTP. What tools do I need to use Temenos Continuous Deployment? Below is a list of tools which may be used to exploit Temenos Continuous Deployment functionality. Tool Description and Rationale Git Git (/ɡɪt/) is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. A client program for Git is required to push artifacts into the configuration repository. SFTP Client SFTP is the protocol used to download file exports (environment or database exports) Design Studio Design Studio is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) produced by Temenos for developing changes in T24 systems. Design Studio itself does not form part of the Deployment Platform, but change outputs from this tool are supported within the Configuration Repository.

The clients will be supplied with a URL and initial login, from there they will be able to create their own environments at their chosen release, add users for a developer or team of developers and then they can create the environments immediately. The users can create up to the maximum number of environments purchased, once the environment is destroyed, another individual or team can create a new environment up to the maximum. Thus many users can share a single subscription, removing collaboration barriers across the project team while supporting automated testing.

Login to your organization on the TCD (Temenos Continuous Deployment) portal ( portal.temenos.cloud ) read and accept the privacy notice. Create an Environment To see how to create an environment, please also check this user guide. Note For this user guide, there are two environments created: DevEnv DevEnv1 These will be used to see how to export the DB from one environment and import it into the other one. Amend a customer record Go to User Menu > Customer > Amend Customer In the new screen, type a customer number from your db (ex. 190094) and click Find Then click amend button Change the GB Town/City from the Physical Address tab and then press Commit the deal button in order to save the change. Note You can do any change on any record type)* Two notifications about Customer's documents will pop up > Mark them as ' Received ' and Click \" Accept Overrides \" > Transaction is complete The next step is to authorize the record change: Log out and login with a different user (in production, this user will have special rights) Go to User Menu > Customer > click Authorise/ Delete Customer menu Click authorise button ( double-check ) > The screen is expanded with the details of the customer > Click again authorise Export the Database To export and re-import the database into an environment or do some changes and import it back or to a different environment, check the steps below: Click the Export button under Database Confirm the action on the pop-up to be able to proceed Click Confirm After clicking the export starts (the action takes around a few minutes based on the DB size). While exporting, the button is disabled. After the export is done, the button is enabled back. To see the logs sequence for the Database Export go the Events tab on your environment: Note To avoid database corruption, all TSA and user activity needs to be stopped so a DB Export can be taken safely. Please note that the same steps showed in this demo can be followed to export an environment. Start exporting by using the Export button (check the available buttons under **T24 Release **section). During this action, the DB is exported through SFTP server to which you have to connect in order to download the related content on your local machine. Download WinSCP from here . Open WinSCP and create a new site which will allow the connection through SFTP server: For host name, use the endpoint of the db. (You can copy it from your portal by clicking the copy icon near the endpoint of the database - 'sftp.temenos.cloud'). For the user name, put the PaaS user name that you have created on the portal. (Check Users tab to see the available users). Instead of password, click Advanced A new screen is open Choose SSH > Authentication > and browse for the private key related to your portal user > click OK. After attaching the SSH key, click on save button – here we can give a site name that we want for future use. Previous screen will appear - click login to connect to the SFTP server. It will search for host and connect to it. A successful connection will display two sides as follows: On the left side - the location from your local machine where the db will be downloaded. On the right side - the location of the exported db on the SFTP server; the DB is saved in the folder with the organization id and environment id ( /organisationID/environmentID folder structure ). The database appears as TAFJDB.zip. In order to download the zip, select it and press F5. After is being downloaded, you can unzip it to see the db file. After this step, you can close the SFTP connection: Session > Disconnect. Clone the Target Environment For each Environment there is a Repository associated to it. This repository needs to be cloned locally and then the database will be pushed into it. Next step is to deploy it to the Temenos Cloud target environment (DevEnv1 in current example). To be able to clone, you need to have a GUI Git Client installed on your local machine. Example: Tortoise Git Also, during cloning, it will be necessary to attach the private ssh key related to your portal user. (If needed, please check this user guide). Login to your environment on the portal, locate the endpoint of the repository and copy it by selecting it OR clicking the icon on the right. Create a folder on your computer (you can place it anywhere on your local machine). In this example is named 'GitDemo' Click right inside the folder and choose Git Clone (this command belongs to TortoiseGit) In the screen that opens, fill the following: in the URL textbox, paste the Endpoint of Repository Application of your Environment (previously copied) the Directory textbox to your local repository folder should be automatically determined as current folder location load the private key (this is the private key corresponding to the public key of your portal user) click OK The content is downloaded from the repository of your environment to your computer, displaying a success message if the cloning was correct. You will be able to see the corebanking repository structure with several folders like: addons, client_files, packages, plugins, updates, wsdl etc. The TAFJDB.zip must be placed into client_files > h2db folder: In case you made changes to the db file, please make sure you archive it as a .zip and rename it TAFJDB before pushing it into the repository. The naming convention is always TAFJDB.zip where TAFJDB is case sensitive and the extension -.zip- is lowercase . If this condition is not satisfied, the database will not be uploaded to the Cloud Environment. Also note that this procedure will replace the existing database in the cloud with this one. The old database will be lost, including any records loaded manually. The SQL database must be uploaded to the client_files\\sqldb folder: The file extensions of the database must be .bak, .zip or both (i.e. in case of more .bak files need to uploaded, you can add them under a .zip which would also reduce the size during the Git deploy operation). See below how the sqlb folder structure will be: Note: the .zip or .bak file can have any name. Nonetheless, the database name within the SQL database backup file must be UTPSQLDB. If the database name is other than UTPSQLDB, the database deployment will not work. The database credentials, schema security group access, logical/physical file names, etc, should be followed as in UTP SQL model bank database. By default, the Recovery model parameter is ‘FULL’, incase of a larger database/more transactions involved, then it is preferred to set the parameter as ‘SIMPLE’. This parameter will be retained after DB import/cloned to a new environment. one or more databases (each file must contain the database name, the database credentials, one or more DBs as well as the SQL server version). For this user guide we added two databases with a .bak file extension that were zipped and placed into the sqlb folder UTPDLMDB database is not mandatory, users can have a single database(UTPSQLDB) within the backup file (.bak). In case you need to convert the database from H2 to SQL DB, please raise a PACS ticket. Commit and Push the DB Click right inside the h2db folder and choose Git commit master , check the not versioned files that you want to push (in this case TAFJDB.zip), put a comment in the box, then commit and push. After the success message, close the box. Deploy DB and Check the Change Go back to the portal to the target environment and click the Deploy button under the Repository After the deployment is done, you can check the change of the database as follows: Click Go to Application to open a T24 Browser Login with your T24 user and password Under User Menu, go to Customer > Individual Customer > More Actions > Search Live File (from dropdown arrow) and click Go The searched record is displayed > Click on the search/selection button on the left > The GB Town Country line should be changed into Portland confirming the correct import of the database User Permissions Required To be able to perform the above operations the below permissions need to be enabled for your user: CREATE _ ENVIRONMENT UPDATE _ ENVIRONMENT REDEPLOY _ ENVIRONMENT MANAGE _ ENVIRONMENTS ALLOW - EXPORT - ENVIRONMENT To have a better understanding of the user permissions, hover the cursor over the variables and a short description will pop up or click here to read more."

The template file for OSS and TSS are provided at point 6 in this user guide for both OSS and TSS templates. 4. How to deploy an update to an environment? 4.1. Clone the environment repository Refer to this user guide . 4.2 Commit & push the changes to the Environment Repository Note Always Git → Pull before pushing new code in the environment repository. This command fetches and downloads content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. 4.3 Deploy the changes Refer to this page to learn how to deploy the changes to your environment. During the deployment, the Start , Stop , Rebuild , Upgrade and Clone Environment buttons are not disabled. Note It is very important to place the components in the folder with the format that the Temenos Continuous Deployment expects. Otherwise, your deployment fails. Below you can find an exercise with a passed and failed deployment - the root cause is the wrong file format deployed. Passed Deployment: Failed Deployment: 4.4 Standalone.xml file notes There are different standalone.xml templates for TSS and OSS. These are provided to you by us. 4.4.1 The standalone.xml TSS template: don’t change any of the static values the only changes you can apply to the files are in the datasource code block and give a new name (ie. instead of jndi-name=\"java:/jdbc/t24DS\" you can change the name from t24DS to another one) or change the min/max-pool-size. If you want to add more datasource copy the entire code block highlighted below. in the queues add new connection pools (copy-paste the link and change the name, max-pool-size) add custom queues ( copy the highlighted queue below and add another name (ie. instead of tecEventsTopic you can add another name) Other alterations added to the XML file will result in a failed deployment. 4.4.2 The db.properties file - only applicatble for OSS templates! You can place the TAFJDB.zip file in the model-bank-database-h2 folder: The Git Folder Standardisation allows you to add the db.properties file into the TAFJDB.zip. The db.properties file contains the db name, clientdb user and pass: If the folder inside TAFJDB.zip file is renamed, then it is mandatory in the db.properties to add the db-name the same as the db folder name and the credentials for the respective db. 5.

Based on the business needs, the workflow can be customized and the same can be added during the factory set-up. The workflow diagram consists of the following elements that can be dragged into a canvas: start workflow COB - runs various processes that are split into 5 stages (Individual application processes, system wide processes, main system reports, start of day such as standing orders, split month end events, cash flow maintenance and so on-, and online -any non-critical reports and processes which can be run after the system has returned to online mode) based on your contract, the COB button may/ may not appear to all users in the workflow customization stage. see what happens when COB is triggered during a factory run here test workflow - triggers the test request. This button configures the template, components, numbers of Test VMs and the stage from which the test will be picked from during the factory run. end workflow Create workflow To create your own workflow in the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform you need to follow the below steps: Select the Workflow tab from the left menu Click on New Workflow from top-right A new window opens. Add a name and a description to the workflow To define the workflow, simply drag and drop the shapes onto the canvas and connect them with arrows To connect the elements click on Add Edge; to delete any edge or element, select the item first then click on Delete Selected When the elements have been placed and connected accordingly, click Save Workflow. Based on the above diagram, a particular workflow will be sent to workflow service to proceed with the steps defined by the user After the workflow is created, the user can add this workflow to any factory within his organisation (learn here how to set up factories) Edit and delete a workflow Users can edit and delete workflows only if these are not assigned to a factory. to edit a workflow click on the Edit button. In this phase you can change the workflow elements and connections. Click Update workflow once you finish updating it. the Edit Workflow and Delete Workflow buttons are disabled for the Default Workflows Validations the COB and Test elements can be dragged and dropped multiple times whereas all other tasks can be implemented only once. To create a connection the Edit button should be clicked for the corresponding task connection only the users with the permissions listed on the User Permissions Required sub-heading can either manage/ create/ update/ delete workflows User Permissions Required To be able to perform the above operations the following permissions need to be enabled for your user: MANAGE_ WORKFLOWS (enables user to view the workflows for an organisation and assign it to the required factory) CREATE_WORKFLOW UPDATE_WORKFLOW DELETE_WORKFLOW To have a better understanding of the user permissions, hover the cursor over the variables and a short description will pop up or click here to read more."

    "keywords": "Metadata API/UI – Feature Description A metadata is a key-value pair that represent an organization specific information (For example “Artifactoty_URL” / “http:xxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxx/xxx”) to help with the functions and workflows of the Extend and Assemble modules. An organization can have any number of such key-value pairs to enable operations. Every Key (from the Key-Value pair) within an organization needs to be unique and cannot be duplicated. The system will throw appropriate errors when such duplications are attempted. Each metadata, apart from the “Key-Value” information, also has the below fields: A Unique GUID (Globally Unique ID) – Used for internal references Key – The key that the organization requires Value – The value for the key KeyEditable – Specifies if the key of the record is editable. This is used by the system and prevents users from editing the key itself. But allows edit of the value if “editable” is set to true. Editable – Specifies if the key-value pair is editable. Keys with editable false are always created by the internal system and users cannot edit such records Deletable – Specifies if a record can be deleted by a user. Similar to Editable, such keys are always system generated and cannot be deleted by a user. Encrypted – Values for such keys are stored in an encrypted form in the DB to protect sensitive data. The UI featues will not allow modification of the following fields: Editable KeyEditable Deletable Encrypted"

    "title": "Run Factory",
    "keywords": "Run Factory After setting-up a factory (see configuration steps here , go to Dashboard on the main menu and select the factory you created (in case you have more factories). Note In order to run your factory, make sure first you select the stream and stage where you created the factory (top right) . If the factory has never been run, you will notice the following message on the screen, under the respective factory: The factory has never been run before. Please start the factory process now by clicking on the Run Now button. Click on the Run now button. If the factory has been run at least once, a pop-up appears which enables you to proceed with the factory run by creating a new transact environment or skipping the factory environment creation for the current factory run. This functionality is useful when you want to change the tests and use the same Transact environment used for a previous factory run. Option 1 : If you want to skip the factory environment creation and reuse the environment from the previous factory run, select the option Reuse the existing environment from previous factory run without overwriting it and click on Run button. Option 2 : If you don't want to skip the factory environment creation just click on Run button. See the following scenarios if you choose to skip the factory environment creation: Scenario 1 - If the factory environment status is STARTED , the factory run will trigger directly the test environment. Scenario 2 - If the factory environment status is STOPPED and previous environment status is STARTED - the factory run automatically starts the environment and once it is STARTED , it triggers the test environment. Note If the factory environment creation has failed during the previous factory run, it is not possible to use it for your current factory run. You need to first identify and solve the issue in order to see the Reuse the existing environment from previous factory run without overwriting it in the pop-up. Otherwise this checkbox will not appear in the pop-up. Once the Run button is clicked, the process is initiated and it gets immediately to the stage where an environment based on your chosen template is created: During the factory run you are able to: See the duration of total time between different stages and the status of the current stage Click on the Actions button to: 2.1 View Environment - check the creation of the environment. The name of the environment will be \"Env for Factory xxx\", where xxx is the name of your factory (in our case Env for Factory Demo _ Factory) 2.2 View Event History - see the logs of the factory run 2.3 Abort a factory run by clicking the 'Abort' button on the top right side of the page (i.e. in case of a mistake). This action prevents you from deploying, testing or promoting the components. By clicking on Abort a confirmation pops-up which asks you to confirm the action. You can edit the factory and then click 'Run now' again to see the results. Refresh the timeline by clicking on the Refresh icon Note The environment creation stage may take between 20 minutes and a few hours depending on the template used. A factory can be enabled or disabled at any time. If a factory is disabled, factory runs (both scheduled and user triggered) will not be triggered. After the environment deployment phase is complete, the next phase (stage) is Running Test Deploy. During this phase a test environment is created (you can check it under Environments tab). Note that this environment is automatically deleted after the tests are run and the process is completed. After running the tests successfully, you will see some details about all stages and the results, as in the example below You are able to do the following: - click to view the test scripts location in the Artifactory (you need to login with your user credentials) - click to download the factory logs - click on the downloadable icon to store the results on your local machine - click on the modular eye icon to view the test results in a new page as below: Note The Test Results URL is accessible as long as the portal login session is valid. When the portal session expires, the test results page throws a 401 error. Based on any factory run, the user can take several actions: Trigger New Environment - trigger a new environment to do triage, demo or ad-hoc testing (this will clone the factory environment) View Environment - directs you to the environment created during the factory run View Event History - view the flow of status of the factory run Create New Template - this contains all the components that were associated with the factory run environment. This new template will be visible in the Templates Catalogue. Note The 'Create New Template' button will be available only if the factory run is successful. If you want to have the creation of the new template enabled even when the factory run fails go to General on the left side of the menu and select the 'Setup Factory' tab. Tick the 'Yes' value that corresponds to the key 'Do you want to allow creation of template from failed factories'.

    "title": "Selenium Template Implementation",
    "keywords": "Selenium Template Implementation This page provides information about the Selenium Template, the pre-requisites needed to test the template, as well as an example of the framework structure and the manifest file. Implementation The Selenium Template will provision the following: Windows Server 2016 Datacenter Edition with the below software/packages pre-installed: Open JAVA / JDK 1.8 the latest version of Google Chrome and Firefox Browsers the latest version of Google Chrome driver the latest version of Gecko Driver The Google Chrome Driver and the Gecko Driver are downloaded to the F:/TCD/WebDriver folder in the provisioned VM. Test Script Structure The test script component that can be used by the Selenium Template must be a .zip file within a .zip. The parent .zip file can contain multiple zips of tets (see screenshot below): Each test suite is assumed to be a suite of tests that can be executed. Name of the test suite can by of any name. Each test suite should contain the following files/folders: One or more Executable .jar files The jar files contain the binaries of Selenium+Junit test cases or Selenium only test cases to be executed. If the test framework makes use of junit, it must generate all the junit test results to a “junit” folder under the folder specified in the global.properties (sys.test.results.folder). If the test framework is Selenium only framework, it should generate the consolidated results in a file called ‘consolidated-results.xml’ under the folder specified in global.properties (sys.test.results.folder). [Note:] The Selenium Template will consolidate all the junit results from this folder and produce consolidated results in case of Junit based test framework. The Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform will move these consolidated results to a centralized storage account and provide a download facility from the dashboard. Lib Folder The lib folder contains the libraries used by the Selenium framework. We expect all the library files to be present in the same folder and the relative path should be handled in the test framework. All the libraries (.jar) referenced or required by the testcase jars must be included in the Lib folder. global.properties file The properties file holds the configurable parameters used by the Selenium framework. Some of the parameters have static values. Thus, the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform expects them to be present in the properties file. For instance, sys.tcdenv.transact.host=127.0.0.1 value is replaced dynamically at the run time. The same applies to all parameters highlighted in the RedBox below. The property sys.tcdenv.transact.host can be used to build the URL (browser, browserweb,…) to test. The name of the properties file must be global.properties and it must have the following mandatory properties: • sys.tcdenv.transact.host=127.0.0.1 • sys.test.results.folder=F:/TCD/TestResults • sys.web.driver.folder=F:/TCD/WebDriver • The Selenium template will change the values for the above properties at the runtime after the test VM is provisioned The above three properties are also available as Environment Variables on the Test VM, so that the values for these properties can be accessed as System.getEnv(“< >”) in java code or as % % as java arguments. Optional properties like the following can also me mentioned in it sys.t24.login.username1=XXXXXX sys.t24.login.password1=XXXXXX sys.t24.login.username2=XXXXXX sys.t24.login.password2=XXXXXX It is assumed that the usernames and passwords will be known to the clients while writing the test cases and the same will be present in the golden copy. This property file can have any other properties needed by the jar files. The Selenium Template will not alter/change the values for these properties. CommandsToExecute.txt A text file that contains the list of all the java commands to run/execute the test cases in separate lines The expectation is that each command to start with “java” as anything other than a Java command will be considered as deployment failure. The Selenium Template will execute all the java commands reading this text file line by line. The Selenium Template will also validate the lines in this file whether they are java commands before execution If any of the line in the text file is not a valid java command, results in the termination of Factory Run. Test Results Consolidation 1. Selenium + Junit Test Framework The test framework should write all the test results to the “junit” folder under the default test results folder specified in the global.properties (sys.test.results.folder). The Selenium Template looks for the junit test results in specified folder for consolidation. After the execution of all commands for each test suite, the Selenium Template runs a consolidation utility that consolidates all the junit test results and produces a consolidated-results.xml file and a corresponding html file. 2. Selenium Only Test Framework The test framework should generate a consolidated-results.xml which contains information regarding the test run, i.e. the total number of cases, success count, failed count etc. The generated file should follow the sample specified below. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?> <!-- configured only by authorised user--> <Manifest> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>get <https://t24URL/BrowserWeb</TestCaseName>> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>PASS</ReportStatus> </Report> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>setText (id signOnName *****)</TestCaseName> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>PASS</ReportStatus> </Report> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>sleep (sec)</TestCaseName> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>PASS</ReportStatus> </Report> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>setText (id password )</TestCaseName> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>PASS</ReportStatus> </Report> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>sleep (sec)</TestCaseName> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>PASS</ReportStatus> </Report> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>sleep (sec)</TestCaseName> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>PASS</ReportStatus> </Report> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>sleep (sec)</TestCaseName> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>PASS</ReportStatus> </Report> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>sleep (sec)</TestCaseName> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>PASS</ReportStatus> </Report> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>switchToFrame()</TestCaseName> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>FAIL</ReportStatus> </Report> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>setText (id commandValue CUSTOMER I F3)</TestCaseName> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>FAIL</ReportStatus> </Report> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>sleep (sec)</TestCaseName> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>PASS</ReportStatus> </Report> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>sleep (sec)</TestCaseName> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>FAIL</ReportStatus> </Report> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>sleep (sec)</TestCaseName> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>PASS</ReportStatus> </Report> <Report> <ScenarioName>Temenos Testing</ScenarioName> <TestCaseName>sleep (sec)</TestCaseName> <ExpectedResult></ExpectedResult> <ReportStatus>PASS</ReportStatus> <ReportImagePath>F:\\TCD\\TestResults\\automation-screenshots\\screenshot4955634319564025885.png</ReportImagePath> </Report> <passedTests>11</passedTests> <failedTests>3</failedTests> <totalTests>14</totalTests> <Name>Temenos Automation Testing Framework</Name> <toolVersion>1.2</toolVersion> <startDate>2020.04.03 09:34:34</startDate> <duration>112.94700</duration> <result>FAIL</result> <hostName></hostName> </Manifest> From the below structure, the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform needs to mandate the following information in order to populate in the dashboard: <passedTests>11</passedTests> <failedTests>3</failedTests> <totalTests>14</totalTests> <Name>Temenos Automation Testing Framework</Name> <toolVersion>1.2</toolVersion> <startDate>2020.04.03 09:34:34</startDate> <duration>112.94700</duration> <result>FAIL</result> <hostName></hostName> The consolidation util will generate the cosolidated-results.xml file with the above details. The below table describes the manifest tags and its purposes. Tag Description passedTests It denotes the prorated number of passed test cases in the current run. failedTests Number of failed test cases in the current run. totalTests The overall test cases count in the respective run. result The overall test result. The value should be “FAIL“ even if there is a single failure. The Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform will use this information to populate the dashboard. Below you will find an example format. The Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform will move these consolidated results to a centralized storage account and provide a download facility from the dashboard for each test suite. Below you can see how the Automation Test Results (summary and packages) Attachments Click HERE to download the sources of the sample selenium-junit test framework, which is based on selenium and Junit and produces the test results in an xml format specified by junit.

    "title": "Stages",
    "keywords": "Stages A Stage is a logical name for a promotional stage. Every component/module developed by an organization needs to go through several steps to be declared ready for deployment to product. These steps are exactly what we call stages. Each stage has the following fields: 1. Name: A simple name for the stage Note The name can only be set on creation time and it cannot be updated . 2. Description: A simple description to be helpful to users. 3. Enabled/ Disabled Flag: A stage can be enabled or disabled at any time provided there are no Factories associated to it. When a new stage is created, an isolated folder is created in the Artifactory Server to enable the binary/ installable components to be uploaded. When the components work well with other components/modules, the component is promoted to other stages, as defined by factories. The promotion of the components across stages is conditional based on the status of tests that are done during a factory run. If the tests succeed, the components will be promoted to the next stage. How to Set Up/ Edit/ Delete Stages Set-up/ Create a Stage Login to the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform: Click on Settings button on the left menu > this will expand a menu containing buttons - click on Stage icon From the top-right select the Stream where you want to add a stage Note: if the stream does not have any stage, a tool tip indicates that there is no entry in the respective drop-down Click on New Stage on the top right Fill the Stage Name and ** Stage Description** Click Create Stage . Note : Instead of choosing the enable option, you can create a disabled stage and enable it later, but the default option should be enable. Edit a Stage A stage can have only the description edited/ changed, but not the name. Why? Because when creating a stage, a folder is created automatically in the Artifactory containing the stage name. This folder will contain the components that you may be added for the respective stage. Just click the edit button, change the description and then click update. Default Stage (Configuration Stage) After logging to the portal, go to the General button on the left menu. Here you can see and edit the metadata. The CONFIGURATION STAGE NAME can be defined after the creation of an organization in order to be able to use the assemble features and can be editable . In case it has not been defined at the beginning, then when you try to create a stream, a new field about default stage will appear and here you need to insert a name for the default stage. This field will be automatically added into the metadata and will not be editable . Delete a Stage Note The default stage cannot be deleted (this is the stage configured into the metadata). Example: Suppose we have created a stage named Primary_stage. No matter if we have configured further components and products, we can just go and delete this stage. Any other created stage can be deleted at any moment as it is not dependent of the subsequent features added such as components and products. Components and Products belong to the streams. Example of the default stage defined into the metadata (you can set any name you prefer instead of Primary_stage ): To see the details of a stage: Select the Stream icon from the top-right-side menu From the top-right select the Stream name you are interested in The list with the stages that belong to the respective stream will be displayed on the left side of the page: Hover over the Name to sort the streams alphabetically.

    "title": "Stream UI – Feature Description",
    "keywords": "Stream UI – Feature Description A Stream is a collective name representing all coordinated efforts by an organization (that are registered to use the Assemble module) to make a specific improvement to their deployed product. For example a bank that is running T24 can choose to make a new enhancement to the T24 installation. All efforts to develop, test and release this enhancement can be collectively called a stream . It represents a group dedicated to a specific development feature (or other logical grouping to represent a new feature implementation etc.) that may consist of the following resources: People – Developers, testers, business managers and other people involved in developing new features for the bank. Code and other digital resources – Code specific to the features, Binaries, VMs, Test Scripts etc. Processes – Each team works with a different workflow and may have variations in the processes. Each stream requires an isolated setup of resources to keep their work separate from other streams. For example, each stream will have a separate folder (or repository) for all of their digital resources and can possibly implement a customized workflow for their development promotion. Each stream has other inherent components for it to be useful. The parts of the stream are listed below: Stages Components Products Factories Factory Run Environments These components, together, act as an isolated group of elements for each Stream and help an organization create and manage efforts of a group. An organization can create as many streams as needed. Each stream is just a logical name for the grouping and has nothing more than a “Name” and a “Description”. How to Set-up/ Edit/ Delete Streams Set-up/ Create a Stream Click on Settings button on the left menu > this will expand a menu containing buttons for: Streams , Stages, Products, Automated Factories, Workflows, Users, General, Release Notes Click on Stream button and then on the New Stream on the top right Fill the name and description (mandatory fields) . Take into account these conditions (also notified on the screen): name can start only with a letter or an underscore and it can contain only letters, digits, underscores or hyphens. Click Create After the successful creation, your stream will appear on the screen (in case you already have other streams, the newly created will be the last in chronological order) and it will automatically have associated the default stage named 'Primary_stage' (as in the current example). Please note that the default stage name is defined in the metadata settings of your organization (On the main menu > General). You can list the associated stages by typing in the Filter field keywords related to the respective stage. You can choose which details of the stream you need to be displayed click on the Columns field and select from the drop-down the information you need to see. Edit a Stream You can edit anytime the name, the description of the stage or choose the enable/ disable option. Click on Update Stream and the changes will be visible instantly. Clone a Stream You can clone a stream as well. This action will copy the latest version of all components in the default stage to the new stream. When cloning the stream, you can add a stream name, stream description and enable/disable it. Delete a Stream Note In order to delete a stream, you need to delete first all the subsequent features created. See example and explanations below. Example 1: Suppose we have created a stream named demostream that has just the Primary_stage and without adding other stages or configuring further components and products. We can just go and delete this stream (even if it has the Primary Stage associated to it). Example 2: Suppose we have created a stream named demostream that has the default stage (Primary Stage) and also a stage named Secondary_stage, without configuring further components and products. In order to be able to delete a stream that has more than the Primary Stage , we need first to go and delete the stages attached to it. Go first to Stages button on the left menu > Select first your stream (top right) > Select the stage that you want to delete (others then the Primary Stage - because this stage cannot be deleted ) > And click the delete button. Go back to Streams and you will notice that your stream has only the Primary Stage associated, therefore you are able to delete the stream. Click the Delete button. If you have added other stages and also components and products, first delete all the products, then the components, then the associated stages and finally you will be able to delete the stream. In case you skip one of these features deletion, the system will notify that is not possible to delete the respective stage.

This Assemble service module further allows the Client to configure Products and Releases, which match their own specific needs. The main objective being to streamline ongoing change and accelerate implementation / upgrade projects. What is the “Extend” service module of the Temenos Continuous Deployment? The Extend module of the Temenos Continuous Deployment is used by the ‘change the bank’ teams for self-service management of Environments and provides access to the tools for enhancing Temenos solutions. The portal enables authorised users to provision Environments from a list of Templates. These Environments are for non-production use during development, test, integration, implementation phases. Features Self-service environment provisioning An authenticated user, e.g. a developer or tester, has the ability to request an environment from the catalogue of templates; this template will be materialised into compute, storage, and networks on the Temenos SaaS. See architecture. The administrator, e.g. the project manager, is in control of number of the users and maximum number of running environments, thus having total control of the platform and its usage. Secure configuration and environment management A developer, is able to configure a personal SSH Key on their user profile and use this key to securely push changes over SSH. Deployment of change into the environment is fully automated for configuration, updates, plugins, add-ons and data. These changes can be stored in a software configuration management repository and deployed to the environment via a Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment process. Controlling the environment A user is able to start, stop, delete, and export data from an environment. Furthermore, a user is able to push a database into the configuration repository and rebuild the environment, thereby refreshing the database back to that point in time and re-apply transactions and configuration as required. As an example, a developer or a tester can load a database and collaborate to validate changes and test cases in a shared environment. Should these users need to delete or migrate an environment, they can export the data, create a fresh environment with the latest release, upload the data and continue working all managed through the portal. Monitoring the environment A user can export the application log data, monitor the status of the environments (started, starting, stopped, stopping, rebuilding), and see the results of any application deployments. Controlling the application The Temenos core banking template exposes endpoints for the user interface and TAFJEE management screens that allows a user to control COB job services."

    "keywords": "How do the cloud templates work? The Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform has the capability to provision environments in a variety of different configurations. This capability is driven through the concept of 'Templates' - a simplified view of the constituent elements which make up a sandbox configuration, including: Server Size Basic server setup and technology stack T24 version to deploy Templates are used by the provisioning service to create Sandbox environments with the desired configuration, as shown below: By default, new Templates are added with each monthly release of T24. These Templates follow a standard pattern, configuration and technology stack, but with the most recent releases of T24 being deployed. However, the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform team also offer the ability to create customised Templates for clients."
