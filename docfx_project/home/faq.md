## **Implementation FAQs**

----------

- **How can a customer gain access to Deployment Platform?**

The client should go through the normal procurement process for a Temenos SaaS service.  Temenos regional sales. 

- **What are the minimum system requirements?**

Internet access over https.

- **How can a customer deploy the TCD (Temenos Continuous Deployment) Platform?**

The clients will be supplied with a URL and initial login, from there they will be able to create their own environments at their chosen release, add users for a developer or team of developers and then they can create the environments immediately. The users can create up to the maximum number of environments purchased, once the environment is destroyed, another individual or team can create a new environment up to the maximum. Thus many users can share a single subscription, removing collaboration barriers across the project team while supporting automated testing.

- **Who will handle customers’ queries/issues for Deployment Platform?**

Support is available through a dedicated online support portal for cloud infrastructure issues.  All Product issues remain through the Temenos Customer Support.
