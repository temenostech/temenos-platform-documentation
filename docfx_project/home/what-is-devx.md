## What is Temenos Development PLatform?

Development PLatform is a product within the Temenos Cloud Platform suite, and is cloud based infrastructure for use during development, test, implementation, and ongoing change with configurable and scalable Temenos Suites on-demand, unless otherwise stated. Development PLatform enables you to create Environments, i.e. Temenos Suites on-demand, for non-production use in the cloud. Environments can be requested and provisioned within minutes rather than weeks helping you accelerate your projects. Retail Suite is readily available, with all other Temenos Suites (Corporate, Wealth, Micro-Finance and Islamic Banking) available on request and allows you to develop and test your proof of concept, share development environments across dispersed teams, replicate production environments or use them for training. The speed, reliability, and agility of these environments will instantly add value to your implementation and scale your project delivery capacity.
