# Introduction & Prerequisites #

This developer guide presents the required configurations and the main steps for the following actions:
 - develop new/existent jBC routines and deploy them to your sandbox
 - import/export applications/enquiries/versions from/to your sandbox to/from your local machine
 - extract from the database/load in the database data (.d) files from/to your sandbox to/from your local machine.
 
For this purpose, you need to have access to:
 - Design Studio(locally)
 - T24 libraries(locally)
 - TAFJ (locally)
 - Temenos Sandbox(cloud)
 - Tortoise Git(locally)  - download from [here](https://tortoisegit.org/download/ "Tortoise")
 
A development package (containing Design Studio, T24 libraries and TAFJ) is provided by Temenos  and it is pre-configured in order to be able to introspect T24 application hosted in Temenos Could Development Dev-X.
This package is adapted according to the T24 version of your sandbox and it is provided as a .zip file. After extracting it in your local machine to any location, the bellow folders and files should exist:
![dev package](./images/dev-package.png)  
The development package is pre-configured to be extracted in _C:\TemenosDev_ path. If the package is extracted in another path(Your_DEV_Path), make sure you make the bellow changes to the development package:
 - in _tafj.link file_ from Your_DEV_Path\DesignStudio\dropins folder, update the path variable with the new path to _TAFJ\eclipse_ folder.(make sure you use '/' as separator between folders)
 - in _tafj.properties_ from Your_DEV_Path\TAFJ\conf, update lines 13, 26 and 42 based on Your_DEV_Path.
 - if a project already exists in your DesignStudio workspace, in _Launch T24 Packager (TAFJ).launch_ file from Your_DEV_Path\DesignStudio\workspace\YOUR-project-packager, lines 9, 10 and 11 must be updated accordingly to Your_Path.  

To be able to interrogate the sandbox database, a series of updates must be applied to _tafj.properties_ file from Your_DEV_Path\TAFJ\conf:  
| **Property**  		| Value	|
|-					|-		|
|temn.tafj.jdbc.url		|	jdbc:h2:tcp://**Your_Sandbox_Database_IP**/TAFJDB;MODE=Oracle;TRACE_LEVEL_FILE=0; TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=0;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;FILE_LOCK=NO; IFEXISTS=TRUE;CACHE_SIZE=131072;MVCC=TRUE;LOCK_TIMEOUT=30000   |
|temn.tafj.jdbc.driver	|	org.h2.Driver |
|temn.tafj.jdbc.username|	t24 |
|temn.tafj.jdbc.password|	t24 |
> [!Note]
> In order to get the database IP of your Sandbox, contact Temenos Cloud support team at <br>CloudPlatformSupport@temenos.com.
