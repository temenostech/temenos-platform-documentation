# Save as New Template

You can easily customize your templates via the **Save as New Template** feature. This self-service functionality enables you to create custom templates from a model bank template in just a few clicks. During this operation component binaries, deployment mechanisms or infrastructure can be changed and new components can be added.

By clicking on the **Save as New Template**  all the components are copied from the environment GIT Repository to Artifactory and saves them as a new template. 

To customize your template, you need to have at least the mandatory components uploaded and deployed successfully. This is to ensure that there will be no issues in any environment created from the new template (read [here](http://documentation.temenos.cloud/home/techguides/deploy-an-update-to-an-existing-environment.html) how you can deploy a component).

## Create a new template ##

After deploying the components:

1. Click on the **Environment** tab from the left-side menu.

2. Select the **Environment** from the list.

3. On the environment page, expand the **Actions** button from the right.

4. Click on **Save as New Template**.

5. Read the information in the pop-up. Fill in the blanks, tick the box and then click on **Save Template**.

6. The template creation is initiated and you will be able to see it in the template catalog shortly. 

7. After the template is created you can find it in the templates catalogue. Unlike the pre-defined templates, those resulted using the **Save as New Template** feature contain the Artifactory URL for each component (go to the *Components List* tab to access them).

## Delete a custom template ##

You can delete a template created through **Save as New Template** feature:

- On the templates page tick, in the filter box the **Custom Templates** - this action triggers the list of  templates any user from your organisation created.

- Select the template you want to delete.

- Click **Delete Template**.

 >[!Note]
 >
 >This button is visible only for the custom templates.
 >
 >You cannot restore a deleted template.

<br>

You cannot delete a custom template if:

- It is used in any factory.

- It is used by any extend environment.

## Post template creation actions ##
After the template is successfully created you can:

1. Provision an environment with the newly created template (learn [here](http://documentation.temenos.cloud/home/manage-environments.html) how to create an environment). 

>[!Note]
>
>If you want to use Design Studio, make sure that the **axis2** and the corresponding **ejb .jar files** are deployed (as of now they are optional). Otherwise the Design Studio will not connect to the environment.
>
â€‹ Similarly, it is up to you to deploy the dsf-iris.war files for the DSF package (learn [here](http://documentation.temenos.cloud/home/techguides/deploy-an-update-to-an-existing-environment.html) how to deploy them). Without these the DSF packages (l3, pre-dsf and post-dsf packages) will not be deployed.



2. Run a factory using the template (learn [here](http://documentation.temenos.cloud/home/techguides/run-factory.html) how to run factories).

>[!Note]
>
>Only Templates which are created successfully using **Save As Template option** are displayed in the drop-down while creating Environments or Factories.
