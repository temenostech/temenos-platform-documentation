# Introduction #
This document can be used by technical staff who need to deploy different features on a Temenos Continuous Deployment Environment. Each Environment has an associated Repository for uploading different type of features based on the Environment Template type, these features being deployed automatically to your Environment.

Before proceeding, please check the following requirements:
- Make sure you have a GUI Git Client installed in your local machine. This guide uses *TortoiseGit* Git Client that can be installed from <a href="https://tortoisegit.org/download/" target="blank">here</a>.
- Make sure you have an user created under your organisation that has a public ssh key attached. Please check this <a href="./user-creation-in-paas.md" target="blank">guide</a> to understand how you can create an user or how you can generate and attach a ssh key to an user.

# Clone Environment Repository #

•	Please login to your organisation, select your environment and locate the Endpoint of **Repository** Application (this is the last available endpoint on the environment page). 

- Click the **copy to clipboard icon** from the right:

![repository](./images/use-git-endpoint.png)

•	Create a folder in any location from your local machine. In the current example, a folder name GitLabRepo is used.

•	Go to your local repository folder(GitLabRepo folder in our example), right click inside the folder and choose **Git Clone**.
![gitlab repo clone1](./images/gitlab_repo_clone1.png)

•	The bellow screen is opened where you have to paste the Endpoint of **Repository** Application of your Environment in URL textbox, set the Directory textbox to your local repository folder(GitLabRepo folder in our example) and load your private key.

•	Content is downloaded from the Repository of your Environment to your local machine.

# Repository Structure #

The repository structure on your local machine should look like this:


![gitlab repo structure](./images/use-git-repo.png)

> [!Warning]
> **Do not delete, change or move the environment folder**. This contains the manifest file.

| Folder 	| Functionality 	|
|-	|-	|
| addons 	| This   folder is designed for AppDynamics. Upload files as JAR. 	|
| client_files\h2db 	| Local   H2 database that will be uploaded to the Cloud Environment. Database username   must be t24 and password t24 (case sensitive). Database name is mandatory to   be “TAFJDB.h2.db” (case sensitive) and must be archived as a ZIP with name   TAFJDB.zip (case sensitive). If the above conditions are not satisfied, the   database will not be uploaded to the Cloud Environment. This procedure   will replace the   existing database in the cloud with this one. The old database will be lost, including any records loaded   manually. 	|
| client_files\helptext 	| Custom   Help Text files can be uploaded in this folder. The file structure must be   the same as HELP.TEXT T24 core. Thus, under client_files\helptext folder, the   HelpText folder with subfolders for each component (AA, EB, PP, etc.) is   expected. 	|
| packages 	| If you intend to upload one or more Design Studio packages, add it here as a .jar file 	|
| packages\l3 	| One or more Design Studio packages can be bundled in a .zip file format and uploaded in this folder. 	|
| plugins 	| WAR files can be uploaded in   this folder. The files will be deployed inside Jboss EAP. In addition to   this, endpoints related to plugins can be automatically added to an   application. For more details, check this guide. 	|
| updates 	| The updates   files downloaded from the portal in zip format. The files will be copied to   the update folder and the T24 Update procedure is triggered. 	|
| wsdl 	| WSDL   files and folders that are required by plug-ins (war file) need to be   uploaded here. 	|

## Additional folders
The bellow folders are not present as default in environment repository. In any of the bellow functionalities is required, the folder related to that functionality must be first created in environment repository and only after this the functionality of the folder can be used.

| **Folder**  				| Functionality	|
|-					|-		|
|client_files\localjars	|	This folder is designed for local JARs (not released by T24 Core) installation.<br />Any JAR file used by T24 or other parties can be uploaded in this folder. During deployment, all JARs present in this folder will be deployed in the environment. If a JAR file is corrupted or some dependencies are missing, the environment will not start.   |
|client_files\localjars\ext	|	This folder is designed for local JARs installation inside **TAFJ/ext** folder from the environment. |

# Commit & Push features to Repository #
•	Go to repository folder from your local machine(GitLabRepo folder in our example) and copy your file/files (related to your required features that must be deployed to your Environment) to the specific folder/folders based on your requirement. In this guide, an update is pushed to the Environment Repository.

*Important: T24 Updates must be packaged as .zip of .zip file while it is deployed through the Git repository (the parent .zip file name can be anything). Example:*
> 
T24-updates.zip
>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |__T24-Updates-2020-X-Y.zip
>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |__ *.Jar

•	To commit the files/files to Environment Repository, right click inside repository folder from your local machine and choose **Git Commit -> "master"...** option.
![repo commit 2](./images/repo_commit_2.png)

•	The following screen will appear in which your repository changes can be observed and commited. In order to commit, you have to input a commit message and check the checkbox next to each new file if it is the case.
![repo commit 3](./images/repo_commit_3.png)

•	The following screen will appear in which you have to push your changes to Environment Repository. In order to push, click the **Push** button.
![repo commit 4](./images/repo_commit_4.png)

•	In the next screen, you have to click **Ok** button.
![repo commit 5](./images/repo_commit_5.png)

•	Finally, the status screen for your push action is displayed.
![repo commit 6](./images/repo_commit_6.png)

# Trigger Deployment #
•	After all required features are commited and pushed to Environment Repository, you have to deploy these features in your Environment. To do this, login to your organisation, select your environment, locate **Repository** Application and click the **Deploy** button.

![repo deploy 1](./images/use-git-deploy.png)

•	The Environment and its manageable Applications status will be changed to <span style="color:#4d94ff;font-weight:600;">Deploying</span> during the deployment process and the Deploy button becomes disabled until the deployment is finished.

![repo deploy 1](./images/use-git-deployment.png)

The logs generated by the deployment process can be also observed in the **Events** tab of your Environment where a new event for *RepositoryDeploy* will be created.
![repo deploy 2](./images/repo_deploy_2.png)

> [!Note]
> The deployment process is triggered **manually** by the user after commiting and pushing all the required features in Environment Repository or whenever is appropiate based on the fact that the user can commit and push features to Environment Repository multiple times and choose when to trigger the deployment.



# Deploy an update to an existing environment #
