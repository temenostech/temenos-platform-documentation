# Deploy an update to an existing environment 
This document can be used by technical staff who need to deploy different features on a Temenos Continuous Deployment Environment. Each Environment has an associated Repository for uploading different type of features based on the Environment Template type, these features being deployed automatically to your Environment.

Before proceeding, please check the following requirements:
- Make sure you have a GUI Git Client installed in your local machine. This guide uses *TortoiseGit* Git Client that can be installed from <a href="https://tortoisegit.org/download/" target="blank">here</a>.
- Make sure you have an user created under your organisation that has a public ssh key attached. Please check this <a href="./user-creation-in-paas.md" target="blank">guide</a> to understand how you can create an user or how you can generate and attach a ssh key to an user.

# Clone Environment Repository #

•	Please login to your organisation, select your environment and locate the Endpoint of **Repository** Application (this is the last available endpoint on the environment page). 

- Click the **copy to clipboard icon** from the right:

![repository](./images/use-git-endpoint.png)

•	Create a folder in any location from your local machine. In the current example, a folder name GitLabRepo is used.

•	Go to your local repository folder(GitLabRepo folder in our example), right click inside the folder and choose **Git Clone**.
![gitlab repo clone1](./images/gitlab_repo_clone1.png)

•	The bellow screen is opened where you have to paste the Endpoint of **Repository** Application of your Environment in URL textbox, set the Directory textbox to your local repository folder(GitLabRepo folder in our example) and load your private key.
![gitlab repo clone2](./images/gitlab_repo_clone2.png)

•	Content is downloaded from the Repository of your Environment to your local machine.
![gitlab repo clone3](./images/gitlab_repo_clone3.png)



# Commit & Push features to Repository #
•	Go to repository folder from your local machine(GitLabRepo folder in our example) and copy your file/files (related to your required features that must be deployed to your Environment) to the specific folder/folders based on your requirement. In this guide, an update is pushed to the Environment Repository.

*Important: T24 Updates must be packaged as .zip of .zip file while it is deployed through the Git repository (the parent .zip file name can be anything). Example:*
> 
T24-updates.zip
>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |__T24-Updates-2020-X-Y.zip
>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |__ *.Jar


![repo commit 1](./images/repo_commit_1.png)

•	To commit the files/files to Environment Repository, right click inside repository folder from your local machine and choose **Git Commit -> "master"...** option.
![repo commit 2](./images/repo_commit_2.png)

•	The following screen will appear in which your repository changes can be observed and commited. In order to commit, you have to input a commit message and check the checkbox next to each new file if it is the case.
![repo commit 3](./images/repo_commit_3.png)

•	The following screen will appear in which you have to push your changes to Environment Repository. In order to push, click the **Push** button.
![repo commit 4](./images/repo_commit_4.png)

•	In the next screen, you have to click **Ok** button.
![repo commit 5](./images/repo_commit_5.png)

•	Finally, the status screen for your push action is displayed.
![repo commit 6](./images/repo_commit_6.png)

<br>
</br>

# Trigger Deployment #
After all the required features are committed and pushed to the Environment Repository, you have to deploy these features in your Environment. To do this, login to your organisation, select your environment, locate **Repository** Application and click the **Deploy** button:

![repo deploy 1](./images/use-git-deploy.png)

• A notification appears which displays the list of components that will be deployed. Tick the confirmation box to proceed:

![deploy components](./images/deploy-components.png)

•	The Environment and its manageable Applications status will be changed to <span style="color:#4d94ff;font-weight:600;">Deploying</span> during the deployment process and the Deploy button becomes disabled until the deployment is finished.

The logs generated by the deployment process can be also observed in the **Events** tab of your Environment where a new event for *RepositoryDeploy* will be created.
![repo deploy 2](./images/repo_deploy_2.png)

> [!Note]
> The deployment process is triggered **manually** by the user after commiting and pushing all the required features in Environment Repository or whenever is appropiate based on the fact that the user can commit and push features to Environment Repository multiple times and choose when to trigger the deployment.

> [!Note]
> Temenos Continuous Deployment uses PROC as the locking mechanism. If you need to change it, proceed via the TAFJEE properties set up. Refer to the TAFJ documentation for more details.

# How Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform installs DS packages
Temenos Continuous Deployment provides users the ability to deploy one or more Design Studio packages into the environment. This pages explains what happens in the background when packages are deployed to the environment.

-  one or more DS packages which with the .jar extension can be added directly into the Git folder packages as shown below.
![](./images/ds-installation.png)

- one or more DS packages can be bundled into a .zip file and put under the Git folder packages/l3 folder 

 ![](./images/ds-installation-l3packages.png)



- the following files are cleared from the environment:

          <T24_HOME>/packages

          <T24_HOME/REL.*.ESON

          <T24_HOME>/REL.*.XML


- Any existing **<TAFJ_HOME>/log/packageDataInstaller.txt** will be renamed to **<TAFJ_HOME>/log/packageDataInstaller-<datetime>.txt**

- all the packages files with the .zip format are unziped to the **package** folder
 
- a backup of the **&SAVEDLISTS& f**older is created

- the **T24PackageInstaller** command is run for all the files under the **package** folder

-  an error message is displayed if the output of the above command is not successful

- all the  files released to DSPackageInstaller folder are copied to l3lib folder

- a module.xml is regenerated based on all the JAR files

- run the packageDataInstaller command. We retry this command until the records from the packages are all deployed or some records cannot be deployed further besides iteration. 

- the output of the command above command is saved into a file in **TAFJ/log** named **packageDataInstaller.txt**. An overall result of retries will be written at the end of packageDataInstaller.txt, which is X0 or X1.

- an error message is displayed in the events log  if the output of the **packageDataInstaller** command gives error X1

- a information message appears in the events log  if the output of the packageDataInstaller command is successful X0

- once the above steps are completed,  an automated task is run to authorize all the exception records

- the **appserver** is restarted and the environment is accesible.

# How Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform installs updates
 When a T24 update is deployed into a Temenos Continuous Deployment environment, either via the [Deploy button](http://documentation.temenos.cloud/home/techguides/deploy-an-update-to-an-existing-environment.html) or during a [factory run](http://documentation.temenos.cloud/home/techguides/run-factory.html), the following steps take place in sequence in the background.

> **Note**: **$T24_HOME corresponds to UD folder.** The environment variables and paths correspond to Linux based environment. Nonetheless, the same set of steps are executed for Windows templates. $T24_HOME corresponds to the path to UD folder. The $T24_HOME/&SAVEDLISTS& contains the UpdateLog and the REL files corresponding to the updates. 
> 
> Please check the files under $T24_HOME/&SAVEDLISTS& along with TAFJ/Log folder in SFTP in case of update failures.

- **$T24_HOME/updater/bin** is given proper rights

- (if it does not exist already) a folder called **T24Updates** is created under **$T24_HOME/../JARS** folder 

- a backup of the  **$T24_HOME/&SAVEDLISTS&** folder is taken and the folder is created again as type UD

- the **T24Version** and the updater command is run from updater/bin

- in the **tafj.properties** file, the precompile path is updated with the **T24Updates** folder path. The path will be $T24_HOME/../JARS/T24Updates:$T24_HOME/../JARS/t24lib

- the automated script stops all the TSA.SERVICE that are in AUTO and START mode. Please check the logs $T24_HOME/SER.LIST for more details on the services that are stopped during this step

- the updates released are copied from the **updates** folder to **T24Updates** folder. In case of service updates, the automated script copies the libraries under the main update folder and not the ones from extensions

- **T24.UPDATE.SERVICE** is run in the environment

- the automated script authorises the exceptions 

- the automated script reverts the **TSA.SERVICES** to their previous state. Please refer to **$T24_HOME/SER.LIST** for the list of services that will be restored during this process.

# How to deploy the DSF packages

To deploy DSF packages, the following components must be present in  Extend/ Assemble environments:

1. DSF Packager artefacts available in the T24 Environment. It is assumed that the UXP license file includes the license for the domain *.temenos.cloud. Reach out to Temenos license team to confirm the same.  

  dsf-iris.war

  dsf-uxp.war



2. IRF Catalog service in T24 environment:

 irf-t24catalog-services.war

3.  IRIS Catalog service in T24 environment:

 t24-eb-catalog-service-ejb.jar
<br>

 ### DSF Package Structure ###

 The l3-pre-dsf-packages and/or l3-post-dsf-packages containing DSF packages have the **format of zip of zip**. See below a  sample package:

 ![](./images/dsf-package-structure.png)
<br>

 ### DSF Deployment Overview ###

 See below what happens in the environment when a DSF packacke is deployed:

- The zip of zip file is downloaded into a temporary file within the TCD environment



- A curl command is executed to deploy the package file in the zip format. See the example below:

 `curl -X POST -L -F "package=@MyTestPack-1.0.0.zip;type=application/zip" http://<dnsname>/dsf-iris/api/v1.0.0/meta/dsfpackages/deploy)`

- The output of the curl command is displayed in the events log
- See below a sample output of a successful deployment (this is available in your **Events** tab on your environment page):

     ![](./images/dsf-package-success-sample.png)

- See below a sample output of a failed deployment (this is available in your **Events** tab on your environment page):

     ![](./images/dsf-package-error-sample.png)

 ### DSF Deployment Notes ###

- For the factory run, the components mentioned in 1, 2 and 3 from the **How to deploy the DSF packages** should be defined in the factory.

- In an Extend environment, there will be two new folders named **pre-dsf-packages** and **post-dsf-packages**:

     ![](./images/dsf-pre-post-packages.png)

- In case you only have one set of DSF package to be installed into a Temenos Continuous Deployment Extend environment, please include the package in** pre-dsf-packages** folder in the GIT.

- We currently support a single file inside the pre-dsf / post-dsf folders. Bundle all your DSF Packages into a .zip file before uploading them
