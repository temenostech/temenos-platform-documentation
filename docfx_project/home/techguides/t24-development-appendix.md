## Introduction & Prerequisites

This developer guide presents the required configurations and the main steps for the following actions:

 - develop new/existent jBC routines and deploy them to your sandbox
 - import/export applications/enquiries/versions from/to your sandbox to/from your local machine
 - extract from the database/load in the database data (.d) files from/to your sandbox to/from your local machine.

For this purpose, you need to have access to:

 - Design Studio (locally)
 - T24 libraries (locally)
 - TAFJ (locally)
 - Temenos Sandbox (cloud)
 - Tortoise Git (locally)  - download from <a href="https://tortoisegit.org/download/ "Tortoise"" target="_blank">**here**</a>.


A development package (containing Design Studio, T24 libraries and TAFJ) is provided by Temenos  and it is pre-configured in order to be able to introspect T24 application hosted in Temenos Could Development Platform.

This package is adapted according to the T24 version of your sandbox and it is provided as a **.zip** file. 

After extracting it in your local machine to any location, the bellow foldimers should be available:

- DS
- t24Lib
- TAFJ


To be able to interrogate the sandbox database, following update must be applied to **tafj.properties** file from Your_DEV_Path\TAFJ\conf:  

temn.tafj.jdbc.url=jdbc:h2:tcp://**ENV_DNS**:9092/TAFJDB;MODE=Oracle;TRACE_LEVEL_FILE=0;
TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=0;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;
FILE_LOCK=NO;IFEXISTS=TRUE;CACHE_SIZE=131072;
MVCC=TRUE;LOCK_TIMEOUT=30000   
 <span style="color:red">Replace **ENV_DNS** with **your environment DNS**.</span> See below example:

<br>

* In the next screen, select **t24-packager-tafj** template from the drop down list and set **tafjHome**, **insertDir** and **libDir** parameters according to Your_DEV_Path.  

> [!Note]
> <span style="color:RED">**VERY IMPORTANT!**</span>
>
> <span style="color:RED">Make sure you set the following values as per below instructions, otherwise the package installation will fail:</span>
>
>  - project-name - always use small letters as per this standard: xx-name (in current example we used: **ft-sample**)
>
>  - release - use the T24 release (example R17, R18, R19 etc.)
>
>  - product-name: use ony two capital letters. **Note** that it must correspond to your project name: 
>   - Example: if project-name is xx-name, the product-name must be XX 
>   - Example: if project-name is ft-sample, the product-name must be FT 


> - component name - must be the same as in project name, after the "-". Must start with capital letter.
>   - Example: if project-name is xx-name, the component-name must be Name 
>   - Example: if project-name is ft-sample, the component-name must be Sample 


> - version: make sure you input the correct version (example 18.11)
>
> - host - login to the portal, go to your Environment > Go to Application > Select the address of your T24 environment (example: https://t24-1abbbbbccc900.temenos.cloud)
