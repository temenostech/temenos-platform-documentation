##  FCM Endpoints

   - The End Points
   - The JSON configuration file

## Main steps to follow

 - Connect to FCM using an SFTP server
 - Place a message to be processed
 - Check the processed message into the application

## Create a User on the Portal

This is required later when logging to the FCM through SFTP server connection, because it checks the authentication to the cloud environment with that specific user and the attached SSH key.

To see all the steps regarding how to add a new user on the portal and to attach the SSH key, please check the following user guide about how to [**Create Users**](../techguides/user-creation-in-paas.md).

## Connect via SFTP Client

 - In order to connect to the FCM app, you can install an FTP client from [https://winscp.net/eng/index.php](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)
 - Open WinSCP application and fill the mandatory fields:
   - Host name > copy it from the environment endpoints
   - User name > input the exact name of the user added to the portal
 - Click **Advanced**

![sftp fields](./images/fcm-sftp-fields.png)

 - In the new screen, select SSH Authentication 
 - Upload the private key previously saved (corresponding to the public key attached to the portal user)
 - Click **OK**
 - Previous screen pops-up, click **Login**

![sftp authentication](./images/fcm-sftp-auth.png)

## Process Messages in the FCM Application

- On the right window, locate your environment ID
*- Your organisation ID appears also on the top*

![sftp id](./images/fcm-sftp-id.png)

- Double click to access the live folders of the environment > Go to **screen_messages** folder > **mt** > **input** < This is where you have to place the messages to be processed by dragging them from the location identified on the left window
- In current case, you can see a file "messages.mtdemo.txt" representing a swift message in the folder named "mt demo" on the desktop. 
- From this location, the file is dragged into the right window in the **input** folder, from where the FCM application will instantly process it and remove/ delete it from this folder (the action won't be visible).

> [!Note]
> Please note that, once the message is moved into the FCM folder (**input**), the application will instantly process it and remove/ delete it from this folder and the action might not be visible. 
> When disconnecting and re-connecting to the server, the **input** folder will be empty.
