# How to access the SFTP using HTTPs

This guide shows describes how to easily access the T24 UD directories of your environment and make updates, using symbolic links on the Web server to the T24 VM machines.

Pre-requisites:

- access to the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform 

- WEB client (i.e. [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) or a Browser)

<br>

Follow the steps below to access the UD directories:

# 1. Change user password 

In order to access the SFTP using HTTPs you need to reset your password (learn how to change it [here](http://documentation.temenos.cloud/home/user-creation-in-paas.html))

After the password is updated the SFTP server can be accessed via a browser:

1. Open a new page and type in the following URL **https://{sftp_url}/{orgId}** where: 

    1.1. **sftp_url** is retrieved from the environment endpoints

    1.2. the organisation ID that is found on the platform URL

# 5. Connect to the environment using a Curl command #

**See below an example:**

    $ curl.exe --insecure -u demouser01:T3m3n0s2o2o#! -T "Desktop/Tasklists.txt" https://jpplatformsftp.dev.temenos.cloud/testupload/
