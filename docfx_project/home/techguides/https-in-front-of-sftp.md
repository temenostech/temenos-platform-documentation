# How to access the SFTP using HTTPs

This guide shows describes how to easily access the T24 UD directories of your environment and make updates, using symbolic links on the Web server to the T24 VM machines.

Pre-requisites:

- access to the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform 

- WEB client (i.e. [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) or a Browser)

<br>

Follow the steps below to access the UD directories:
 
# 1. Change user password 

For the existing users, the access to the SFTP server is available only after the password has been changed. A pop-up message informs you to update it. Click **Change Password** to proceed.

Learn how to change the password [here](http://documentation.temenos.cloud/home/user-creation-in-paas.html). By changing the password, your entry is added in the HTTP server and enables you to access SFTP over the HTTP server. 

# 2. Access the SFTP server

- After the password is updated the SFTP server can be accessed via the endpoints present in the environment details: **Access Environment Files** in the T24 Release section and **Access DB Files** in the Database section:

# 3. Connect to an environment via WEB client

# 4. Connect to the environment using a CURL command #
You can also connect to a Temenos Continuous Deployment Environment using a curl command.
See below an example:

    $ curl.exe --insecure -u demouser01:T3m3n0s2o2o#! -T "Desktop/Tasklists.txt" https://jpplatformsftp.dev.temenos.cloud/testupload/
